    <h1>Background on DevConf 2020 Review Process</h1>
    <p>
        This page is a retrospective guide on how the talks were selected for the DevConf 2020 conference and hope it
        helps
        the community transparency of the process and secondary goal to help others prepare for submissions for other
        events and DevConf 2021. This is the
        communities event and as the organisers we welcome all feedback and improvements for how we can be better
        stewards of the
        communities event. Please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@devconf.co.za">info@devconf.co.za</a>
        about this or anything else about your event.
    </p>
    <p>
        We made use of the <a href="https://sessionize.com/" target="_blank">sessionize platform</a> to collect, review
        and respond to talks. The <a href="https://sessionize.com/devconf2020" target="_blank">call for speakers</a>
        page is
        still available with all the information on it about how the process would be run. Sessionize has a free test
        which you can log in to, get 10 fake submissions and go through reviewing and ranking them if you would like to
        see exactly what we used.
    </p>
    <p>
        At a high level, Sessionize shows a reviewer 3 talks and asks them to rank the talks 1st, 2nd and 3rd (our
        awesome review panel did this an amazing 5338 times!), and once completed it provides a list of talks ranked
        based on that. All the reviewer sees is the title, notes, description and track. If it is not in those fields it
        is not part of the information reviewers use.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are using the team rank explicitly here as the talks were not scored or assigned a rating. They were ranked.
        This is important
    </p>
    <p>
        Talks were anonymously ranked in Sessionize by a panel of 16 reviewers from a diverse background of race,
        gender,
        age, experience, technology and disabilities. Each reviewer was either a previous speaker or reviewer of DevConf
        and thus has had a deep insight into what conference goals are and the type of event it should be. We did not
        provide any official guidance or "marking guide" for reviewers - rather we trusted them to bring their
        experience to the selection.<br />
        Reviewers could provide feedback, but few did and even they did it sparingly. All the reviewers did this in the
        free time without any promise of compensation and spent tens of hours working on it so we do not require them to
        add comments to their reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once that that was done, Candice and Robert built the agenda mostly from the ordered list (i.e. talks ranked 1
        through 40 go in), with a few exceptions:
        <ul>
            <li>International speakers - we only have a limited budget so once we hit that limit all other international
                speakers are declined unless they could pay for their flights themselves. Ability to pay for a flight
                has no impact on ranking, so the talk still needs to be highly ranked.</li>
            <li>A speaker with a selected talk would have all their submissions dropped. This is to allow many diverse
                views and opportunities (one speaker sharing twice in a day vs. 2 speakers sharing once in a day) and
                allow speakers to spend time on the day with the audience and enjoy the event as well as to give them
                time to focus.</li>
            <li>Duplication - If we already have a talk that covers the same ground, we won't select a second one. We
                will have talks on the same topic but in different aspects of those. </li>
            <li>Content that doesn't fit - We published a list of what is good and bad as part of the submission request
                and thankfully the ranking pushes these down so we have not had to drop any highly ranked inappropriate
                talks but that is a possibility.</li>
            <li>Discretionary - As organisers, we need to ensure a balanced and relevant agenda, based entirely on
                community feedback provided over the years so that the conference continues to be a high-quality event.
                We apply discretion only to ensure our agenda suits our audiences varying interests. We are guided by
                our reviewer feedback, community feedback on social media and at meetups and other conferences and this
                discretion is applied exceptionally sparingly. <br />
                A good example from this year is we had 2 similar talks in our top 20 this year, the first talk was, in
                fact, the #1 ranked talk and was from an international speaker, the other was from a local speaker. We
                opted for the lower-ranked one as the local speaker has a better opportunity to understand our market
                (which was relevant to the talk) and we felt they could do as good a performance.</li>
            <li>Where there are similar talks that rank similarly, we would allow the opportunity to underrepresented
                groups.</li>
            <li>We also try to limit too much content in a particular theme - considering most of our submissions are
                about languages and tools, and many ranked in the top 12 but we limited those talks to make room for
                mental health, DevOps and Security, for example.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>How many talks are there?</h3>
        We select 28 talks from 550 submissions, meaning that only 5% of talks get selected.
        <h3>Does being International help?</h3>
        No. We believe the community in South Africa is amazing and brings a unique and powerful understanding that
        international speakers do not have and while for 2020 we used all our international budget that is not a promise
        as seen in 2019 when the community did not rank international talks high enough for selection so we did not use
        all the budget.
        <h3>What can I do to increase my chances for selection in future?</h3>
        Write a great description. Your description needs to do a lot of work for you:
        <ul>
            <li>It needs to provide the detail of the content you are going to present potentially to a reviewer who
                isn't specifically an expert in it.</li>
            <li>It needs to show you know what you are talking about.</li>
            <li>It needs to have something to help it stand out. </li>

        </ul>
        This is difficult to do and talks a lot of writing and polishing to get it perfect. Attending on the CFP
        workshops during the year that is run by the community is a very useful way to skill up here and this is why we
        partnered with other communities to run these for DevConf especially.
        A second tip is to engage in the community throughout the year - if you have an important topic, helping
        reviewers to know it is valuable ahead of conference time is invaluable.
        <h3>Does being a speaker from a current or previous sponsor help?</h3>
        Not at all. The process is anonymous so there is no way it can impact it. In addition your event is run totally
        cost neutral with no profit being taken by the organisers so monetry influence is not possible.
        <h3>Why did the rejection emails not contain feedback?</h3>
        There are three factors that lead to a basic "sorry, you did not get selected email". <ul>
            <li>Sessionize has no way to automate giving even basic information (like rank for example) let alone
                feedback. </li>
            <li>As stated reviewers did not leave feedback for the majority of talks, so even if there was a solution
                there would be no content.</li>
            <li>It is not possible for Candice and Robert to write 500 personal rejections in a timeframe that is
                respectful of speakers who would wait months for feedback this way. </li>
        </ul>
