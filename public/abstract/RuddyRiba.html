We create REST API’s to be integrated to system that are expected to at

the end achieve a business defined goal. We never test against these

requirement and wonder why we have to either add or rework some of

our service because they don’t match requirements. Join me in this

discussion as we bridge the great rift between business and technical

using Cucumber-Serenity. This talk will expose you to writing normal

English scenarios (test cases) that are translated into methods which test

the actual contract you expose to the public and enable rich reporting for visibility.
