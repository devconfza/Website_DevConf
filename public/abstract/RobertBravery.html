Akka.net is a port of Scala Akka. It uses the Actor model to provide a higher level of abstraction for writing concurrent and distributed systems. Getting up to 50 million messages per second on a single machine. Akka Actors have a small memory footprint with about 2.5 million actors per Gig of memory. In this talk we will see how we can use the Akka framework to simply create a concurrent and distributed system. Hopefully looking to show how we can get about 10 million transaction a second (creating text data files) on a simple laptop.
