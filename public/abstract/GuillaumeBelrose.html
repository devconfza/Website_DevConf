This talk will be an introduction to the Elm language (http://elm-lang.org/docs) with live examples featuring the Dark Knight himself (and maybe other super heroes if time allows).Elm is a delightfully simple to learn typed functional programming language which compiles down to HTML, CSS and JavaScript and runs in the browser.Elm is also an opinionated framework for writing simple and elegant single page applications with a clear separation between models, views and updates. Think of it as React + Redux but put together in a single, easy to use framework that checks (well compiles) your code to protect you from all those funny JavaScript errors at runtime. Disclaimer: I am not using Elm in any serious capacity, just currently learning about it. I do however have JavaScript apps running in production.
