Over the last couple of months I have been leading a team tasked with
upgrading an extremely core component of our gaming systems.
There are just 2 requirements for our project to be considered a
success, seems easy right?

Well we need to support near infinite scale (i.e. Google/Facebook
load) for hundreds of millions of users, and everything in the system
has to happen in real-time.
If this system goes down, or runs poorly, the money printer stops.

After lots of research and testing we ended up picking Couchbase as
our primary data store.

In this session I will highlight some of the lessons learnt along the
way - from coding to hardware infrastructure - that allows our
clusters with billions of JSON documents to meet these lofty
requirements.
