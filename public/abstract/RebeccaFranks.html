Starting Android development over 5 years ago, I was really excited to have a working app that allowed me to do simple things. After working on a large scale Android app, I wish I had known certain things before jumping into development. Things like what libraries should I choose, whatâ€™s the best practise for testing and other different pieces of advice that I wish I had known back then. This session will cover a bunch of mistakes and assumptions that I made in the past 5 years of Android development.
