We currently use specific names for different types of tests, like unit, integration and system. I believe these terms have lost some of their value since they don't have universally agreed-upon definitions. In addition, these names don't take into account all the characteristics of tests that we should be interested in. In this talk I will present a simple model for thinking and talking about tests that describes several interesting characteristics of tests and how they relate to each other. The aim of the model is to allow development teams to make better decisions about the type and timing of the tests they write for their systems.
