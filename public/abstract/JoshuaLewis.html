Automated testing is becoming more visible as a critical practice for the development of high-quality and high-value software products. There is a lot of guidance around this practice, for example the Test Pyramid popularised as part of Continuous Delivery. A potential problem with this guidance is that the parameters involved in automated testing are changing all the time, for example the tools enabling automated testing are improving all the time. I developed the Dimensions of Tests Model as part of my coaching and training, with the aim of helping development teams have better conversations around why they want to have automated tests, and to help them decide which types of tests they should write.
