One of the oldest and most harmful misconceptions is that programming and testing are activities similar to manufacturing or construction in mature engineering disciplines, performed after the design has been completed. In this talk I will give the audience a fresh look at growing software, inspired by a 1992 article by Jack W. Reeves: “What is design?” I will show how software product development is a creative, collaborative design process involving the creative energy of all the role players.Finally we will take deep look at modern software design practices like Continuous Delivery, and see how it interlinks with disciplines like Lean Startup and UX Design and allow us to iterate fast toward superior solutions.
