With every increasing speed of delivery required and a great need for exception devs, the amount of companies that can afford to employ a dev for every platform is quickly draining.Additionally, small projects have enough to decisions to make when trying to build the right app for their customer. Every project would benefit from being able to remove the decision of which platform to deliver to first. If it were possible to deliver a responsive app, while still developing for all platforms, it would be a no-brainer.NativeScript tries to achieve this by allowing developers to write in JS and compile down to truly native mobile apps. NativeScript is to Angular 2, what React Native is to React.
