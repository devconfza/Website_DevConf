How is it possible that a seemingly highly skilled team struggle to meet business deadlines whilst a team of average skilled professionals consistently deliver value to their client? Do the skills of the team members have any outcome on the delivery of the team? Of course they do, but without the secret sauce even the best team will fail. The uncomfortable truth is that human beings do not do ANYTHING unless they are sufficiently motivated to do so, despite what they may say they will do. Unfortunately, in most organisations, people learn to say what their managers want to hear and then still proceed to do the opposite. Why do people do this?
In this talk we will explore how an Agile approach makes average teams become great teams through the injection of one vital ingredient: motivation.  We will explore how an Agile approach gets people in all kinds of industries (not only developers!) become motivated to be successful without them even realizing it. The key principles of Agile that, probably coincidently, addresses the fundamentals of human motivation, will be uncovered.
