The growth of the craft beer industry has been a boom stick for a dycotamy of new products, businesses and brewers across South Africa, though, like most businesses, brewers and event's organisers don't utilise the mountains of digital information and feedback available to them. Social media and data analytics tools offer brewers and events the ability to tap directly into the opinions, popularity and conversation of a consumer base that they'd not originally be able to. This intelligence can be most effective in small businesses like brewers who are small enough to adapt a moments notice over larger businesses. I use craft beer and brewers as an example, but, this rules apply to all businesses and corporates in most industries.
