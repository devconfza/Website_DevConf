DocumentDB is a fully managed schema-free global scale NoSQL database service built for fast and predictable performance, high availability, elastic scaling, global distribution, and ease of development. In this talk we will explore what's involved in working with DocumentDB including using the rich and familiar SQL ad hoc query capabilities, using and using JavaScript within the database and what it means to be able to store in DocumentDB for apps written for MongoDB with the new MongoDB protocol support.
