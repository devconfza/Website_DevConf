	<p>Architects, those that design buildings, study architecture from the past to the present to best understand their craft.
	As software developers we aren't easily afforded this opportunity, this has always frustrated me, and has thus lead me to always want to share with my fellow craftsmen.</p>

	<p>In this talk I lift the veil on a two of my enterprise projects implemented using a message based architecture. I walk through the architecture of the projects highlighting the SOA patterns used. The first architecture focuses on patterns employed for performance and scalability and the second focuses on big data principles for data visualisation using projections and the lambda architecture. This presentation also focuses on the do's and don'ts when designing a scalable message based architecture, as well as potential technology you may consider such as NServiceBus.</p>
