<p>Testing is important, but I am lazy. So why spending copious time thinking about test cases when your computer can do this for you in a fraction of the time?</p>
<p>In this talk, I will show you how to use an awesome approach called property-based testing.</p>
<p>It allows you to automatically generate test values based on the properties of the things you want to test, from primitive types, all the way to arbitrary data structures.</p>
<p>Generating copious amount of random data can certainly break things but sometimes you want to find out which particular test case causes your system to fail.</p>
<p>This ability to hone on the particular bug (it is called shrinking) is extremely useful and almost makes property-based testing very hard to distinguish from magic.</p>
<p>I will use Scala, a typed functional programming language as a driver for demonstration, together with the ScalaTest and ScalaCheck frameworks.</p>
<p>The principles of properties-based testing have been applied successfully to many other languages, from Haskell to Erlang and I will briefly touch on those as well.</p>
