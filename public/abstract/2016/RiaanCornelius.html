	<p>Everybody seems to be in agreement that maintenance is the most expensive phase of software development and that we as developers read more code than we write.</p>

	<p>There has also been better adoption of agile methodologies and continuous delivery which are essentially putting parts of your code live (and therefore in maintenance) much earlier.</p>

	<p>What all this means is that there is a very clear need for focused refactoring to make live code more readable and hence more maintainable. Of course, this has to be balanced against the cost implication - rewriting all bad code you come across is not sustainable either.</p>

	<p>In this session we will look at how we can use forensic techniques to identify bad design and the code most in need of refactoring in your projects.</p>

	<p>We will use version control data along with complexity measures to identify hotspots in your code that is not only complex, but that changes often. By doing this we can focus our refactoring on the code that will slow us down most often.</p>

	<p>The techniques used is tool and language independent, so will work on pretty much any project you may be maintaining.</p>
