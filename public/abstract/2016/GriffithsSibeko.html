When I started out with app development I had zero knowledge on app development, all I had was just design skills. I got over my fear starting on developing an app by testing the waters by building an app based on my experiences. After building a few apps, I got to advance my XAML skills. This later got me to build an award winning app with minimum skill set on building an app.
