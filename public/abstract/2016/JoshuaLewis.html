I'm Joshua, and I used to be addicted to mocks. I fell in love with TDD many years ago. In the past, every class I wrote had its own unit test and was perfectly isolated from its collaborators using mocks. More recently, I've changed my specification test philosophy quite drastically, to the point where I now no longer use mocks or other test doubles unless I absolutely have to. I believe my specification tests are now much more valuable, understandable, changeable, and also smaller and quicker to write. My production code is much easier to refactor, and I can also start releasing my code earlier. Let me tell you my story of rehabilitation and liberation from my addiction to mocks and how I came to see the light.
