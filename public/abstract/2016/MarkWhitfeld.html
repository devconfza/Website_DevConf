I have heard so many developers say "TDD is great in concept, but I can't use it in my current project. I'll wait for my next project to introduce it..." and they never do.
Let's be honest TDD is not easy, especially when you have a large legacy code base to deal with, and if you are waiting for the perfect situation to start it may never come around. You need to make it happen.
This talk will give you practical handles on how to introduce TDD as one of your development practices in your existing brownfields (legacy) project.
When do we start? Well, there is no better time than the present!
