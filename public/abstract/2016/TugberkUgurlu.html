<p>The World we live in today makes us deal with a lot of information. The solutions we put out there also have the same problem. We collect a lot of data through our applications and we try to give these data back in a non-asphyxiating fashion. Doing this with a single data storage technology will make you feel definite agony even on a medium-scale solution. Furthermore, it's next to impossible to provide a viable solution in a large scale products like Foursquare and Twitter.</p>
<p>This is where polyglot persistence comes into picture. As much as the word "polyglot persistence" sounds extremely fancy to your ears, it's also not that straightforward to adopt in a solution; especially in existing ones. Come and join me in this session to learn about what most matters in this type of architecture to build a viable, maintainable solution. Also, I will be talking about how to make decisions to choose the right data storage technologies based on my personal experiences I gained with the side project I am spending my nights on.</p>
</p>By the end of the talk, polyglot persistence should seem less scary and you would at least have a one real world example in your mind on how a solution is being architected where polyglot persistence is the solid foundation.</p>
