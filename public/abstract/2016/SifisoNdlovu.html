Some of the benefits of switching from a row representation of data into columns is that it enables one with an ability to pivot a given dataset which can lead a reduction of the size of your dataset. For instance, if you have 5 rows with each indicating the number of apples bought by Themba over 5 months – you can use SQL Server to rotate the data around in a such a way that only one row is displayed with all Themba’s apple-buying history. Therefore, this proposed session utilises SQL Server Management Studio client, SQL Server Statistics and Actual Execution Plans to illustrate row-to-column representation of data using SQL Server built-in methods such as CURSOR, PIVOT, XML and Dynamic Transact SQL.
