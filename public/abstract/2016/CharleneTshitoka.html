	<p>Nowadays, infrastructure automation is a necessity to achieve repeatability of deployment processes across multiple servers with minimal/zero human intervention. Yet, mere automation has proven to be insufficient when trying to keep up with ever growing business requirements.</p>
 
	<p>Tools such as Puppet, Chef and Ansible have consequently emerged to ensure versatility and consistency of automated infrastructure. These tools provide ways to treat server provisioning and configuration management as we would treat software source code; thus making it possible to apply software development practices.</p>
 
	<p>Unfortunately, just like with the rest of our software code, infrastructure code can grow difficult to maintain when good practices are not followed thoroughly. And that is even a bigger problem when multiple teams are involved.</p>
 
	<p>In this session, I will share my experience of some Chef anti-patterns. I will then discuss the approaches that can be taken to address them. More specifically, I will show how software principles such as DRY, domain modelling and versioning can make a difference for teams who need to collaborate on automated infrastructure.</p>
