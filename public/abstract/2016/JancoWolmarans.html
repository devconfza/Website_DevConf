Most developers have an idea of what refactoring is, but can quickly paint themselves into a corner by not sticking to a safety first rule. Statically typed languages typically have great refactoring support, yet developers tend to rather rely on a slower refactor-compile-fix-errors cycle than a safely-refactor cycle during development. This session will address the true meaning of refactoring, and how using small, safe refactoring steps can actually speed up development, reduce stress, help you live longer, and swear less.
