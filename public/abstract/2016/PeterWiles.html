	<p>Graphs are great for discovering connections between things, but what if you want to search as well as do recommendations or exploration? It's time for polyglot persistence: store your connections in the graph, the indexed documents in Elasticsearch, images in some random key-value store, logs in Splunk and maybe some tabular data in your SQL Database. </p>

	<p>It's not rocket science, but I would like to share the way we designed our data stores to connect the graph and other stores elegantly. I'll start with a super-quick overview of Neo4j and Elasticsearch and then dive straight into connecting the two. I'll follow that up with why you might want to do this, and what kinds of applications could you build with it.</p>
