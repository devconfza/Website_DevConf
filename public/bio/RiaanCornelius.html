I'm a software developer who develops mobile apps for Discovery by day and tries to find ridiculously interesting projects to tinker with by night.My decade of work experience includes setting up an SMS service for USAID in Afghanistan, consulting on a mobile CRM system in Costa Rica and helping out with systems for an SMS campaign during presidential elections in Zambia.My tinkering has included computer vision, robotics and home automation projects. This has led to talks on using Sci-fi interfaces as inspiration, using computer vision to keep physical and electronic scrum boards in sync and getting started with robotics using Javascript.
