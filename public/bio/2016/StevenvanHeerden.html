<p>I started out as a developer 15 years ago when I became fascinated with automation and how it could solve many of the problems I was experiencing. I currently lead the DevOps team at Derivco and co-host the Durban DevOps Meetup group. I am passionate about collaboration and automation, and spend a large amount of time finding ways to improve our software delivery pipeline and bringing people together to work on complex problems.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not at work I enjoy spending time with my family and taking time out to run, cycle or workout at the gym.</p>
