	<p>I am a self-employed consultant doing Software Engineering (mostly in Scala) and DevOps (mostly with Ansible). I am from Martinique and I've been in South Africa for over 3 years.</p>

	<p>I currently work in the TV broadcast industry building software solutions to help media companies produce news and sport content.In a previous life I was doing a lot of work on distributed systems and configuration management at HP Labs. I've started the Scala and Ansible Meetups in Johannesburg where I try whenever possible to hammer in the benefits of functional programming and automation while feeding people some pizzas.</p>

	<p>I've given talks at Meetups in Johanesburg and at Tech4Africa on topics such as Scala, DevOps and Continuous Delivery.</p>
