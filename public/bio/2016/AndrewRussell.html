<p>My name is Andrew Russell. I am currently working as a Team Leader at Chillisoft a company based in Hillcrest, KZN.
	I have about 20 years of commercial programming experience and have worked in a number of sectors including commercial and investment banking, transport, insurance and government. I have worked on many greenfields and brownfields projects over the years and worked with a wide range of developers.</p>

<p>At Chillisoft I am responsible for driving our deliberate practice (as a company we spend about 5-6 hours a week working on sharpening our skills outside of our production work)
	and I am also involved in running some of our tSQLt training courses.</p>
