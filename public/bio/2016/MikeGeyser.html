Mike Geyser is a programmer at BBD, specialising in designing and building for the web
platform. He's been hacking on the web since geocities was a thing, has a long-lived
love affair with javascript, and has (almost) come to terms with the fact that he will
never have a programmer beard. While he has worked on some interesting large-scale
enterprise applications, it is the challenges of the public web that really appeals to
him - having earned his stripes on high volume transactional websites. He works primarily
in javascript, C# and (unfortunately) java, and seldom refers to himself in the third person.
