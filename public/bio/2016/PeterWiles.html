	<p>I love software development, doing it, reading about it. I'm tech/ops director at Chillisoft, and with the growth of our software dev company I seem to now do more telling other people how to software develop, but I'm also more invested in maximising the effectiveness of software developers - both from a tools and personal effectiveness point of view.</p>
