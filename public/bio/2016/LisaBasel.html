<p>My software engineering background with +-7 years as a C++ developer gave me a practical 
understanding of the intricacies that are involved in teams of smart creative people creating 
	successful software. </p>

<p>My first job at Nokia in Cambridge UK in the 90’s gave me a benchmark for what teams can achieve. I 
was disappointed and despondent when coming back to SA. Spending a few years in our corporates, 
I felt very dis-empowered and frustrated as a developer. I started learning “tricks” and an attitude 
that enabled me to develop successful products despite the constraints of the organisation and team 
I was working in. Since then I have worked in inspirationally successful teams and dysfunctional 
	teams.</p>

<p>I have been always been fascinated about understanding what makes the difference between happy 
and dysfunctional teams. I have had to grow and learn hard lessons on how my mind-set and 
attitude affected the team and therefore the success of the software created.
Running my own custom software development company and co-founding a start-up gave me the 
opportunity to create and grown many teams myself. I also got to play all the different roles in a 
development team – tester, developer, product owner, scrum master, project manager and even the 
	support consultant on my own product.</p>

<p>I now have lots of opinions, ideas, practices and tools. I use these extensively in the teams I am now 
	leading. </p>

<p>I fill my “spare” time with mentoring young entrepreneurs, testers and developers
