I work at Dariel, contracted out to do development jobs at clients. I am currently working on a Big Data project using MongoDB doing ETL and analytics. I am a MongoDB certified developer and have set up a proper production cluster using MongoDB enterprise. I previously worked on a project involving setting up a SQL data warehouse and doing ETL and analytics. I have done presentations at international conferences about conference papers I wrote for academic purposes.
