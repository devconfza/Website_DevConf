I've been in the IT and Development game since the 1980â€™s. My first computer was a Sinclair ZX Spectrum with 48K ram. I've developed code in more than 16 different languages and scripts. I have a passion for software development, designing and delivering the right software in time with as little defects as possible. I am a manager and Senior Developer at IQ Business.
