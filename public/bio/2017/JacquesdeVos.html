I'm founder of nReality and a software engineer who divides my time between coaching software development teams and building software products, mostly mobile (both native and hybrid). Most of my experience has been in developing crucial font-end applications in the financial industries: online trading, online banking, insurance and branch banking.I have plenty of SA and international software industry speaking experience, highlights being Agile 2015 Washington DC, and Agile Australia 2016. This is a new talk which I have been working on for months, and I plan to present it at a few events â€“ I think it speaks to one of the biggest misunderstandings in software creation.
