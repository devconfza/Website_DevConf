I'm a technical all-rounder with many years of experience working with the various incarnations of Microsoft development tool and have worked extensively with SOL Server throughout my career. I currently work at Microsoft South Africa as a Cloud Data Solution Architect. Most recently I have been working on projects utilizing Azure SQL Database and Data Warehouse, Azure Stream Analytics and Azure HDInsight (Microsoft's Azure distribution of Hadoop). I particularly enjoy the intersection of electronics, math, data and innovation.
