Hi, I'm Theo. I've been a practicing Software Craftsman for 9 years now, I love Software development, love teaching it and eating an elephant one piece at a time. I've embarked on what I can only call my calling: A code school, The Coding Ground, for individuals that cannot afford it. O yes, I'm also addicted to flying stuff.
