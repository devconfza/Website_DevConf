I've worked at Business Connexion and a few small companies and I will be running a dev start-up from 1st of January '17. I have a B.IT degree and a M.A. in Organisational Leadership.With a team Â of friends, I've written and presented my own full financial seminar. I've presented many times at a pre-marriage seminar. I've given a similar talk as the one I'm planning to give at DevConf to the Pretoria Dev User Group (you can ask Sean or Terence who were hosts for feedback). I haven't given a talk at a conference like this before.
