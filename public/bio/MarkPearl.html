I've been involved in creating software for over two decades. Most of the time I have gotten it wrong, sometimes I've gotten it right. As I get older it feels like I am getting it right more often. I find nothing more fulfilling than being involved in creating something that has a real impact on other people's lives.I'm currently an engineering lead for MYOB in Auckland.I love sharing the insights I have gained from these experiences with others - I do this by speaking at events, writing andfacilitating workshops.
