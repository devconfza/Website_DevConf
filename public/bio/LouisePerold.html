<p>A brief description of who you are and any talks you have given previously (max: 300 words).
Testing is not just a career to me, it is a massive part of who I am. I have been blessed to come across people who have inspired me and taught me and I believe I have been that person to others over the years. 
The learning never stops though, and I continue to practice the craft and apply learnings from other disciplines back into software testing.
Building the craft and community of testing in South Africa is also a passion of mine. To this end, I am the co-organiser of LetÕs Test South Africa and the founder and co-organiser of the Joburg Software Testers Meetup. 
	I am also one of the founding members of ISST  - the International Society for Software Testing and a member of AST (Association for Software Testing). </p>
	
	<p>I enjoy speaking at conferences and have spoken at LetÕs Test in Sweden, Copenhagen Context and CAST in North America and served as the co-program chair for CAST 2013.</p>

	<p>As Director and Consultant at House of Test South Africa, I am hoping to continue working with awesome people, partnering with friends whom I respect and working my butt off to promote $hit HoT testing.</p>
