<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>The talk is about understanding the developer skills problem in South Africa (and also more broadly). It uses the
    research of Kruger and Dunning to explain how the perception of skills can be devastating to the IT professional's
    career</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>With 20 years of hard-fought industry experience, Greg has been many things through his career. A developer, an
    analyst, various flavours of &quot;Architect&quot;, and even a Manager (Ughhh). </p>

<p>Although there is little doubt that Developer is the best of them all, he is probably best described as a solution
    architect. On the tech front, he spends his time in the Integration-focused open source world, which covers
    technologies like Apache Sling, Karaf, Felix, ActiveMQ and Camel. However, earning a living frequently requires
    more mainstream technologies, like Adobe Experience Manager. </p>

<p>He gets his hands dirty on any project that needs a helping hand, especially if the helping hand can be involved in
    exploring new technologies.</p>

<p>When he's not at work you're likely to spot him in the Drakensberg with an SLR around his neck, or in his organic
    vegetable garden.</p>
