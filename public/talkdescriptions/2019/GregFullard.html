<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Like gravity, the general lack of developer skills is a reality, whether we are ready to acknowledge it or not. Of
    course, it is a global problem, but South Africa's unique environment has made the problem significantly worse or
    us. In addition to demand far outstripping supply, we have another reality: The technical capabilities of
    developers coming out of our education system are frequently shocking. On an annual basis, I cannot help but notice
    that the pool of graduates who can actually add practical value to projects is getting smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>This situation has many effects, but the one I'm most concerned about is the how it impacts the capable developers
    on a team. For example, if your 10-person team includes 4 incapable team members, your customer still expects
    delivery by a team of 10 people. Which means the rest of the team have to make up the difference. On most projects
    this places heavy strain on senior team members who need to work extra hours to make up for the work not getting
    delivered by others in the team; And if you combine this with Scrum Masters and PMs who are constantly pulling tech
    leads into meetings (because they don't have an adequate understanding of the solution themselves) we end up with
    over-burdening the most valuable team members.</p>

<p>This talk looks at the problem from the perspective of a capable, senior tech lead. It investigates whether it makes
    sense to be a &quot;Hero Programmer&quot;. The guy (or girl) who stays up late and ensures deadlines are made.
    Nobody can argue that Hero Programming takes a toll on your health and private life, but I'm interested in
    investigating whether it is a sensible approach at all. </p>

<p>Through anecdotes from many past projects, and by referencing the research by Kruger and Dunning into
    &quot;Perceived Competence&quot;, I explore different strategies for delivering your projects successfully, even if
    you are stuck with a team who aren't exactly rock-stars.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>With 20 years of hard-fought industry experience, Greg has been many things through his career. A developer, an
    analyst, various flavours of &quot;Architect&quot;, and even a Manager (Ughhh). </p>

<p>Although there is little doubt that Developer is the best of them all, he is probably best described as a solution
    architect. On the tech front, he spends his time in the Integration-focused open source world, which covers
    technologies like Apache Sling, Karaf, Felix, ActiveMQ and Camel. However, earning a living frequently requires
    more mainstream technologies, like Adobe Experience Manager. </p>

<p>He gets his hands dirty on any project that needs a helping hand, especially if the helping hand can be involved in
    exploring new technologies.</p>

<p>When he's not at work you're likely to spot him in the Drakensberg with an SLR around his neck, or in his organic
    vegetable garden.</p>
