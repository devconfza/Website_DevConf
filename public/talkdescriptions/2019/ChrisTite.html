<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>We use time boxed cycles, shorter feedback cycles and small defined outcomes to run software projects. Why not use this approach to mentor and grow staff? </p>

<p>Why do we subject our teams to a sterile and delayed feedback KPA / KPI approach in the tech industry, an industry that is growing and experiencing rapid change?</p>

<p>These are all questions that puzzled me.</p>

<p>Four years ago I started mentoring team members using an agile approach which was refined over time and with each iteration, it is now an accepted and valued practice on all my teams. </p>

<p>This is my story.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll unpack;</p>

<p>* The agile mentoring approach and the mentoring life cycle * The different personas and people patterns adopted in agile mentoring * The tools used to manage the process * The career framework applied * Lessons learned</p>

<p>Join me as I share a fresh approach to mentoring team members which ultimately results in;</p>

<p>* Higher job satisfaction and less burn-out among employees * More confident teams with focused learning outcomes  * Higher staff retention</p>
