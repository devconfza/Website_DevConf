<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>We embarked on a rather daunting journey a couple of years ago to replace our Point of Sale (POS) solution in all
    our stores. During the project we have overcome many challenges and have learnt amongst other things: how to work
    better as a team, how to adopt agile processes in a corporate waterfall environment, how to avoid rabbit holes
    (although this still needs some work), how to architect and design a solution which meets all short and long-term
    functional and non-functional requirements, etc... and the list goes on...</p>

<p>The focus of this talk, however, is on the lessons we have learnt leveraging great architecture, design patterns,
    standards and technology to deliver a truly cross-platform, enterprise-ready, world-class retail application. I
    will briefly cover the high-level requirements for a POS solution which must be flexible, resilient, performant,
    scalable and secure. The architecture, design and technology we have employed to successfully deliver on these
    requirements will then be examined in more detail.</p>

<p>The technologies which I will focus on include Xamarin (.NET Core, Android, MVVM, PCL, UWP, WPF), WCF (MSMQ, REST)
    and Entity Framework (code first and migrations). Then I will also touch on how technologies like Azure and Docker
    will be leveraged in the very near future.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>Wayne Beckley is currently the product lead and solution architect for the new Point of Sale initiative at The
    Foschini Group (TFG). He has been involved in IT and the retail industry for the last 18 years. Over the course of
    his career, he has fulfilled several roles including developer, business analyst, project manager, technical lead,
    line manager, integration architect, development architect and enterprise architect. He derives the most pleasure
    and energy from architecting and developing solutions and is probably going to stick to this until he retires to
    his coastal holiday home (which still needs to be purchased). During his time at TFG, he has focused mainly on
    solutions in the stores and E-Commerce domains which help TFG realise their strategy &quot;to be the leading
    fashion lifestyle retailer in Africa whilst growing our international footprint&quot;. He is passionate about
    reducing complexity, maximising reuse and leveraging technology efficiently. He also firmly believes that in
    software development, the root of all evil (and bugs) is not following standards.</p>
