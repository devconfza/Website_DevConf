<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Many developers are under the mistaken impression that Kotlin is just for the Android platform. However, more and more developers are starting to use Kotlin for web backends and even frontends. </p>

<p>This talk will touch on the most popular language features of Kotlin. However, the bulk of the talk will consist of demonstrating that Kotlin can and should also be used for full-stack web development. I will take the audience through the development of a web app using Kotlin/JVM on the backend and Kotlin/JS on the frontend, using Spring Boot and React respectively.</p>
