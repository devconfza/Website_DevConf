<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Did you know, a diverse team is 35% more likely to produce above-average results? From the science behind why diversity boosts performance, to why being the only woman in your project team is more of a problem than you might think, this talk takes a closer look at the realities of inequality in our industry, how each one of us has a role to play in the solution and what we should be doing to move our industry forward.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered about how we improve diversity in software engineering, or if you&rsquo;ve never wondered, then this is the right room for you.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>Twenty years in the industry, fifteen of which as a hiring manager, seven at board level, four as a reformed unicorn (you&rsquo;ll have to attend to hear that story) has given Claire a fairly well-rounded view of where we&rsquo;re still going wrong with equality in software engineering and made her an enthusiastic champion of improving gender parity in STEM education.  She once built a LEGO Death Star.</p>
