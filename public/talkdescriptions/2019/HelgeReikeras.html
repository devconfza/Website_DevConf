<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>In this talk, we'll dispel the common myth that you need a room full of PhDs to implement data science and machine learning into your software product. We'll present data science and machine learning as another tool that everyone involved with building software should have in their toolbox. We'll talk about the concepts, tools, and resources that a software developer needs to get familiar with, the value that data science and machine learning can bring to a software product, and how to get started doing it yourself.</p>
