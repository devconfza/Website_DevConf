<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>How often have you had to advise a client which cloud provider to use? Our usual answer, as developers, is &quot;It
    doesn't make much of a difference&quot;. That said, we've had a bundle of scenarios where there are subtle
    differences between the providers that can make a big impact.</p>

<p>So we're putting the 3 big cloud giants (AWS, GCloud and Azure) against each other! We want to learn which cloud
    provider can do it (a) the cheapest (b) with the most ease (c) the best performance (d) with the best debugging and
    support. So that next time a client asks us &quot;which one?&quot;, we can give an empirical answer</p>
