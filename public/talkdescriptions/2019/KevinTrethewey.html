<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>There's no shortage of guidance around the internet on how to become a competent software developer. It's an exciting road to travel. But, what comes after you've reached a level of competence? What's beyond that horizon?</p>

<p>As a programmer in the late ’90s and 2000s, I focused on growing my competence in a pragmatic "what works?" sort of way, and readily adopted ideas that were useful.</p>

<p>For a decade or so after that, as a coach and consultant, I frequently provided context-free general advice that was aligned to innovative ideas that had worked for me in the past but didn't always have a lasting impact for the people and teams I was coaching.</p>

<p>Today, as a technical leader working with teams of developers across the world, I’m growing a deepening understanding of what really matters when creating software.</p>

<p>The 6 key fields I plan to traverse...</P>
<ol>
<li>Narrative - how the world is shaped and we shape our world </li>
<li>Reality - how the underlying reality tends to show through</li>
<li>Humans - how ultimately, creating software is about humans</li>
<li>Systems - that seeing and understanding the patterns and interactions is vital</li>
<li>Knowledge - in order to use it well, we need to respect its fundamental properties</li>
<li>Flow - knowing how to see and manage transitions over time </li>
</ol>

<p>My goals for this talk is not to convert people to my viewpoint. I'm not selling anything. I'm hoping to bring some ideas to people who've reached a level of competence in our field, and perhaps some reassurance to those who intuitively see that much of today's industry dogma is just plain wrong.</p>
