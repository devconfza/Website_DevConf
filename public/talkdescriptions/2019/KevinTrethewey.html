<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p><i>&ldquo;Reality is that which does not go away when one stops believing in it&rdquo;</i> - Philip K. Dick</p>

<p>There are deep patterns that play out again and again in our industry and it&rsquo;s hard to notice them if you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention for a while.</p>

<p>Innovative ideas synthesised in a particular context (for example TDD, Micro Services, XP or Scrum) are then generalised as they are more widely adopted until they become so abstract the ideas lose their effectiveness. Books are written on the abstractions. Industries spring up to profit on the popularity of the abstract ideas. They become context-free dogma. Small pockets of people start to ignore the dogma and focus on what works, starting the cycle again.</p>

<p>As a programmer since the late &rsquo;90s, I focused on what worked, and readily adopted ideas that were useful.</p>

<p>A decade or so later, as a coach and consultant, I frequently provided context-free general advice that was aligned to innovative ideas that had worked for me in the past but never seemed to have a particularly large impact for the people and teams I was coaching.</p>

<p>Today, as a technical leader I make and observe so many micro-decisions on an hourly basis that I&rsquo;m growing a deepening understanding of why my coaching lacked impact.</p>

<p><b>After all this, what have I found Really Matters when creating software? </b></p>

<p>My answers might surprise you. </p>

<p>For some, they may also challenge your current way of thinking, but my goals for this talk is not to convert people to my viewpoint. I'm not selling anything. I'm hoping to bring some reassurance to people who intuitively see that much of today's industry dogma is wrong. That we've been focussing on the wrong thing, and that when I've shifted my focus to what matters in reality, great things have happened.</p>

<p>Some key talking points I plan to traverse...</p>

<p>* Detecting (and avoiding) dogma * The importance of core communication skills in software development * The impact of separating decision making from doing the work * How mindset affects people&rsquo;s realities, and the micro-decisions they make * The difference between changing reality and changing the perception of reality * How leaders at all organisational levels set the tone for context and its interpretation * Organisational structures and the behaviour patterns they generate * The problem with training/certification * Approaches to change that work</p>
