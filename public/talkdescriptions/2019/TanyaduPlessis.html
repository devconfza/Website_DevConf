<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Do you ever feel that the fire inside you has burned out?</p>

<p>Burnout is a prevalent issue among IT professionals. A recent Blind survey shows that an average of 57% of employees from 30 tech companies reported burnout.</p>

<p>People in the IT profession are especially prone to burnout due to high job demands manifesting in a variety of forms, such as high mental and emotional load and frequent irregular working hours or excessive amounts of overtime. This in combination with environmental factors such as trust in leadership, alignment in values and communication all contributes to factors that can lead to burnout.</p>

<p>Some of the dangers of burnout are that it is not always easily identifiable and may not necessarily be limited to jobs requiring long working hours. Additionally, a person may not always be aware that he or she is experiencing it. With one of us have spent 15 years working in the IT industry and the other being a registered Industrial Psychologist, we as a couple have personally experienced and had to deal with the impact of burnout more than once in our lives.</p>

<p>We, Tanya and Riaan, would like to share our experiences as well as equip the audience with some tools for identifying, understanding, preventing and dealing with burnout.</p>
