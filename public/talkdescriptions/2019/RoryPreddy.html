<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>My life is a hilarious roller coaster of miss-intended programming bugs because at 4 foot tall and 65 kilograms I
    completely fall off your radar.</p>

<p>What did my scale call me! Why does facial recognition see me as a child? These are all valid questions I often ask
    myself as I navigate my weird and different world. Have you heard the phrase &ldquo;You have to be this tall for
    Micro-services&rdquo;? well, what about: &ldquo;You have to be this tall to operate a mobile phone?&rdquo;. I am
    finding it harder and harder to reach any button except for &ldquo;#&rdquo; and &ldquo;9&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Building accessibility into the planning stages of programming can eliminate barriers for participation and create
    an inclusive environment for people with disabilities. Programming for diversity serves as an unquestionable
    indicator that your software embraces the diversity of your users and cares about their safety and comfort.</p>

<p>Join me on a fascinating and thought-provoking look at how you can program for accessibility.</p>
