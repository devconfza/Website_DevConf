<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>As a developer, I was fascinated by this concept of usability, a seemingly magical quality that somehow makes a world of difference for the ones that use our product. I spent the first 10 years of my career as a dev, went through a phase as a TDD fanatic, then landed up getting into interaction design and user experience. I was able to teach myself about UX from mostly free resources I found online.</p>

<p>So, what is it like for a software developer to transition their career into doing UX full time? Experience design, like any other discipline in software, is one that can be learned by anyone who is willing to invest the effort. I will share why I decided to quit programming for a career in UX and a few insights about how designers and developers can work together more effectively from a shared understanding.</p>
