<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>One evening, my little sister asked me for help with her homework at 9pm. She had already asked her classmates on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was able to help as all her peers had the same limited resources available to them. This gave me the idea for Buza (Zulu for &ldquo;ask&rdquo;), a platform for high school learners to ask questions that could be answered by volunteer university students in their free time. Buza is the first side project of mine that I&rsquo;ve ever truly wanted to deploy. After months of coding and adding loads of features, I finally reached out to a senior developer to help me deploy my truck of features. The first thing she said was &ldquo;A lot of this code will have to be replaced with production-ready code&rdquo;. These are words you never want to hear.</p>

<p>University Computer Science equipped me with the ability to write code to solve problems, but in industry extra skills were required to build production-ready software. This talk will share the valuable lessons I learned from getting this Django web app production-ready. This will start with how to choose the right tools, framework, environment for your project. I will also cover how to set up testing and continuous integration for your project.</p>
