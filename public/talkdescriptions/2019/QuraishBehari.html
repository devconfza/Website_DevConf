<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>The power of tech is not tech. It&rsquo;s people. The people who dream it, code it, eat, breathe, sleep, live it
    every minute of every day as they pour their hearts and souls into making, shaping, crafting&#8230; creating.
    It&rsquo;s at this intersection of creativity and technology that the magic happens. So how do you create an
    environment where these creative technologists can thrive? Overthrowing the yoke of legacy, Quraish Behari takes a
    look at fear, failure and freedom in this thought-provoking session on culture and creativity.</p>
