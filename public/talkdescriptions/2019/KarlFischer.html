<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Where Test-driven development and Infrastructure as code have a love child.</p>

<p>Everything around you is made up of atoms, DNA or code, there is a recipe on how everything is put together, and like most things... as soon as things get created organically it gets messy. With the advent of composable infrastructure or infrastructure as code, we need to focus more on getting reproducible systems as opposed to a patchwork of chaos. Using Test Driven techniques we can create and implement reliable, repeatable infrastructure.</p>

<p>Some slides, lots of memes and of course gorgeous un-canned demos</p>
