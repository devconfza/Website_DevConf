<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>In this age of instant gratification - having software that is fast and responsive is non-negotiable. Thankfully with a few decent designs and testing techniques, we can achieve this.</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t look to use the most innovative or advanced software, they want to use the most responsive. We expect things to happen now or even sooner and as a result, it&rsquo;s become increasingly important to have software that not only performance rapidly, but scales appropriately. However, to build software that is high performing, you need to put systems in place that can help you easily identify your performance bottlenecks and respond to them appropriately.</p>

<p>In this session we will look at optimal coding considerations, the different approaches to load and performance testing and how you can apply these in different software solutions.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>A man of many talents, but no sense how to use them. Craig could be out saving the world but would prefer to make software instead. Craig has a passion for software design, but more importantly software quality and designing systems that can achieve this in a technically diverse and constantly evolving world.</p>

<p>When not playing with software he can often be found writing, designing board games or running long distances for no apparent reason.</p>
