<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Welcome to 2019: You Twitch-stream your ironing, your car thinks it is smarter than you, and catapults have Wi-Fi!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to go through using game-engine physics simulations (because ALGORITHMS!) to design and optimize a small self-loading desk catapult design, then CAD&rsquo;ing it for 3D printing, and finally hooking it up to an Arduino to control from a phone over Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t your grandfathers' catapult! (Unless you give it to him, I guess?)</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>Matt Cavanagh is a developer from Durban who hates writing bios in the third person. He started a company called roguecode making Windows apps, but then decided to be poor was a better idea so went into game development. He&rsquo;s done talks at conferences like DevConf, and TechEd (when Microsoft still knew SA existed).</p>
