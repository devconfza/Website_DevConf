<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Level: Intermediate. In this talk, We will focus on how to split up an old enterprise application which has become a monolith into microservices. We will examine the pros and cons of doing so and also the best design practices and architecture decisions that will ensure this process is a success.</p>

<p>We will mainly explore how to identify services in your monolithic application, identify seams in your monolith. We will also investigate how to decouple microservices from monoliths and the best practices when doing so. We will also focus on microservices development and DevOps such as scalability, load-balancing monitoring and reliability.</p>

<p>We will be examining how to extract a monolith application using example PHP microservices that were pulled out of a larger legacy PHP application. I will also investigate some war stories on how Superbalist achieved this and the lessons learned along the way.</p>

<p> At the end of the talk, you will know better how to refactor your monolith and improve your own architecture.</p>
