<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Developing a product is fun, these products connect us, and accepting payment across countries is one of many ways
    to scale a product.<br />
    This session will concentrate on showing developers how to integrate multiple African payments flows (such as
    MPESA, MOBILE MONEY, CARD, USSD and more) into products via One API.</p>

    developer communities in Africa.</p>
