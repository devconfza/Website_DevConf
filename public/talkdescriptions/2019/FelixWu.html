<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Unit Tests measure the quality and effectiveness of your production code. But ever wondered how effective and relevant your tests are? Meet Mutation Testing: Bugs, so-called Mutants, wrong return values, for example, are automatically inserted into your code to test whether your tests fail - if they do, the mutant dies, if they pass, the mutant survives. The higher the percentage of mutants killed, the more effective your tests are. In this talk, I will introduce the attendees to this relatively simple, but ingenious way of checking that your tests will spot malfunctioning code, and show some live mutation testing in different languages.</p>
