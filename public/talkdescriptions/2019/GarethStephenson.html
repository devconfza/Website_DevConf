<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>For my Masters degree research project, I chose to perform a controlled experiment with a group of volunteer software developers. The experiment was to test the theory that Mob Programming positively affects team communication and learning, compared to working in a self-organised team formation. One requirement of the experiment was for the volunteers to complete a &quot;Big Five&quot; personality traits assessment, to see how they scored against the traits of Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.</p>

<p>The data collected from the assessment, along with the answers from the questionnaire at the end of the experiment, provided some valuable, quantitative insight that could be of great value to anyone who works in a software development team.</p>

<p>In this talk, I present the findings of the experiment and what it could mean for you and your team.</p>
