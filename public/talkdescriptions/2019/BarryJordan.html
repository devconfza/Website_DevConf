<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Micro Service architectures have become, for many, the default architecture of choice. While the thinking and
    patterns around domain driven design and the exposed (mostly RESTful) interface design have evolved, many of the
    coding patterns, practices and underlying technologies from enterprise development have bled over into a world
    where they are either over-engineered, or simply redundant. Golang is a language that was designed for efficiency,
    concurrency, scalability and most importantly, simplicity. Its standard library provides many tools out of the box
    to support the development of micro services, and its simplistic language constructs and concepts allow a gentle
    learning curve for budding Go developers.</p>

<p>In this presentation I&rsquo;ll talk about why we chose Golang as our micro service language of choice, the toolset
    that it brings to the table, and about how it has aided and encouraged a more simplistic way of thinking about how
    we develop our software.</p>
