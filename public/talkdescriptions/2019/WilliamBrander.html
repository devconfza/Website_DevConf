<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>The only certainty in JavaScript is change. There is a new, cool framework popping up seemingly every week. jQuery, Knockout, AngularJS: all were once the darlings of the web, now relegated to the scrapheap of legacy. One day you will abandon your current favourite framework too, as it slowly falls out of fashion. How then do you choose an appropriate JavaScript framework? How do you make sure that the next framework is the one? Better still, how can you work with your favourite framework today, while still working within your legacy application?</p>

<p>What if you don&rsquo;t have to choose the right framework? What if legacy never got in your way? Join me as I show you how you can take lessons from MicroServices and use them to let you work with new, exciting frameworks even in applications based on older, legacy, technology (no microservices required)</p>
