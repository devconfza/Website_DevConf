<h3>About the talk</h3>
Audience Level: Beginner <br/>

So many aspects make up being the best developer you can be yet we tend to focus almost exclusively on the obvious ones like learning the next library, framework or methodologies. Here we will explore some critical practices you may be missing that will not only improve your craft but your life.</br>
Our industry moves fast, there are new libraries and frameworks created every day, not to mention all the updates and features added to the ones we already use and love. There is a constant drive to deliver more, to increase velocity, to meet and exceed deadlines. We celebrate the culture of “being totally swamped” and wear it as a badge of honour. Impostor syndrome is real and can make us feel like we have to keep up with everything and it’s just simply not possible to do so. We don’t let this simple fact stop us from trying and we make bad trade-offs that are actually detrimental, leaving a trail of destruction through our bodies, our minds and sometimes even our family and friends.</br>
What if I told you that the world you live in is a prison for your mind, that it doesn’t have to be that way? As The Oracle told Neo, you will have to make a choice. There are techniques that will allow you to lead a better life, some you may already know but just don’t practice and some may be more esoteric. In this talk I will be distilling the years of self-help research and practice that I have personally gone through to show you how you can improve the quality of your life, not just to make you a better, more effective developer but a happier more grounded person. Naturally, as we are all in the tech field, I will be showing you some really awesome tech solutions to help you on your journey.</br>

Some of the topics we will be looking at are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Essentialism</strong> - Lets you focus on doing less, but better</li>
<li><strong>Purpose, vision and goals</strong> - To guide where you should focus your energy</li>
<li><strong>Stoicism</strong> - Because life is often fraught with hardships</li>
<li><strong>The habit loop and the power of rituals</strong> - because 40-95% of what we do is automatic</li>
<li><strong>Boundaries</strong> - Because being a people pleaser is a surefire way to make yourself miserable</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness</strong> - lets you be actively present in your life</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition, Exercise and Sleep</strong> - cliché but for a reason</li>
<li><strong>Getting things Done®</strong> - Once you have stripped away the non-essential, you still need a system to help you do it</li>
</ul>
