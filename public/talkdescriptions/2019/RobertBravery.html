<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Facial recognition has always been the domain of science fiction. But not anymore. The technology is now available for us to now enter the world of Sci-Fi. Our face is a unique, intimate reflection of who we are. It represents our identity, character, emotions, age. Our brains recognise different faces and their unique characteristics. Our faces are the primary point of contact, especially within the human race. Our emotions and facial expressions are part of every aspect of our lives - how we learn and communicate, how we understand one another, how we interact with each other. Yet in today's world of technology, our face and emotions are mostly absent from our digital interactions. Up until recently, it has been difficult for the average developer to write software that will recognise facial differences, facial aspects and even emotion depicted by facial expression. Can we write software in C# to identify a picture, identify facial objects such as eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, etc. and then identify emotion in that picture. The human face can create about 5000 expressions. Can Facial Detection Software understand those expressions and identify the emotion. Technology is now available for us to write software that will recognise and identify faces and facial objects, understand emotion, and predict a proximate age. This talk will explore how we can do that. We will write and demo software that will be able to recognise faces, identify the emotion. Time permitting we will use this to explore Facial Bio-metrics. We will then look at different use cases and see how this technology can be used.</p>
