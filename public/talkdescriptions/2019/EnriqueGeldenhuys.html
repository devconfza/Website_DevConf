<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Closures, generics, inheritance, functional programming, microservices, and reactive programming: what do all of
    these have in common? While they have powerful capabilities and varying levels of popularity, they also have the
    power to be abused and misused.

    In this talk I want to discuss the rise and fall of popularity for different programming concepts and paradigms.
    What some of them try accomplish and the benefits of them, but I also want to discuss how none of these paradigms
    are golden hammers, and how each of them have trade offs.

    This talk is aimed at all experience levels with a focus towards helping senior developers responsibly mentor
    juniors. I want to highlight how touting these programming concepts and paradigms to junior developers, without
    proper context, can quickly leave the code unmaintainable.</p>
