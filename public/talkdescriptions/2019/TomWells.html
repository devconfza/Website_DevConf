<h3>About the speaker</h3>
<p>Tom holds a BSc (Information Systems) Honours in Computer Science from Rhodes University in Grahamstown. His
    childhood was spent war-dialling with his 2400 modem, researching and building blue-boxes, harassing local BBS
    sysops, and being k-lined off ZAnet IRC servers. Although he wrote his first qbasic program at age 7, he sharpened
    his skills through reverse engineering, virus writing and social engineering hacks throughout high school. At
    university, he met a group of like-minded hackers, learned to program C, installed Slackware Linux and once again
    got k-lined off IRC. His passion lies in the field of applied cryptography and building open, hyper-scale and AI
    enabled technology platforms.</p>
