<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>IoT, one of the biggest buzzwords of our time. What does this world of &ldquo;things&rdquo; mean for people who
    create software? We are not the people who are good at connecting the wires and components and we really
    don&rsquo;t want to have to worry about that little bit of static electricity that can blow up that fancy
    microchip.</p>

<p>In this talk, I would like to show you how we can write good quality software for devices. Let&rsquo;s talk about
    where the software fits in, or as I like to call it, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in IoT.</p>

<p>Level: Beginner</p>
