<h3>About the talk</h3>
<p>Level: Beginner</p>

<p>IoT, one of the biggest buzzwords of our time. What does this world of &ldquo;things&rdquo; mean for people who create software? We are not the people who are good at connecting the wires and components and we really don&rsquo;t want to have to worry about that little bit of static electricity that can blow up that fancy microchip.</p>

<p>In this talk, I would like to show you how we can write good quality software to connect devices. How we can use cloud providers to collect and analyse data from different devices. How we can take the multitude of devices that already exist and make them smarter. In this way, we can use the skills we already have to do things that were not possible without IoT. We can create software that runs on devices and makes our lives and the lives of others easier.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about where the software fits in, or as I like to call it, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in IoT.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will cover some of the histories of the Internet-of-Things, where the phrase came from and how it became such a big buzzword. I will then show some examples of IoT devices and how the more popular these &ldquo;things&rdquo; become the easier they are to build and use. There will be some hardware examples to emphasize this.</p>

<p>After this, I will go onto showing some of the code used to program these devices and how you can use the cloud (in this case Azure IoT Hub) to collect and analyze your data. I will also show how we can program devices to communicate with the internet and each other.</p>

<p>This is not a buzzword talk, this is a talk about writing good software for devices.</p>

<p>In the last few years, we have had a number of IoT talks at different conferences and meetups. Most of these talks focus on the fun parts, building devices and how to program them. This talk will be slightly different.</p>

<p>Although I would still like this to be a fun talk, it will also contain a lot of information that software developers could use when putting into a situation where they are required to build devices for large corporate solutions. I think this is needed in order to understand why IoT is not just a buzzword people like throwing around. We need to understand it and where we fit into it.</p>
