<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>For years and years, network pen-testers have owned companies and networks with playbooks written in the 90’s. With a good mix of footprinting, scripting and unexpected interdependence, even moderately skilled attackers have been able to reign supreme without ever needing a 0day. How does this change as organizations slip more and more into the cloud? What do rootkits look like and what does lateral movement mean when its between different SaaS products? In 2009 we took an initial stab at answering some of these questions, and now we’re revisiting the topic in light of the huge strides made in cloud services.</p>

<p>We cover a few recent attacks on companies that leveraged cloud services, showing security failures can occur on the boundaries of, rather than solely in, services. We demonstrate easy and novel ways to embed compromise detection capabilities in third party services without requiring support in those services. We show how developers can be attacked with malicious code editor plugins. We tackle the gorilla, Amazon Web Services, revealing a series of attacks that cover reconnaissance, compromise, lateral movement, privilege escalation, persistence and logging disruption. Lastly, we end off describing how to aid compromise detection in cloud services.</p>
