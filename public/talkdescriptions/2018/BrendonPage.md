### About the talk

The building metaphor that is so often applied to software development is broken. Why do we need to start with the foundations first? The roof we’re building is virtual, it can float! So why not build it first? Or even better just the part that we need first.

We’re so used to building software from the bottom up that we don’t even realise that it involves an incredible amount of guess work and ultimately results in a lot of hidden waste. In this talk I examine and challenge current thinking about the order in which we build software, thinking which I believe has been perpetuated by the building metaphor we use when we teach new software developers and when we communicate with non-developers in the industry.

He is an avid TDD’er, loves teaching and spends a lot of his spare time speaking at or running dev focused community events. Lately a lot of his thinking has been around how to be better at writing software with a primary focus on the thought process of the developers themselves.
