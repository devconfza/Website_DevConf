<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>Bots, AI and Cognitive learning is going to change the way we life, how we think and how we work. It will also change how
    we code and how we analyse data. Automated and driverless vehicles are one example of software bots and mechanical robotics
    interacting. Deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) will make it possible ask virtual bot assistants questions
    in a natural way and get meaningful answers. Analyzing huge amounts of text, social media posts to understand sentiment
    and thought process will be a huge advantage to business and even government. Face-recognition and photo-analysis at
    the hands of the populous makes searching and analyzing digital data easier smarter and more accurate. Lear how we can
    make use of Bot Frameworks, AI Frameworks and Cognitive Frameworks that are available today to achieve what we might
    have thought previously impossible or event at the least out of our reach.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>

<p>I’ve been in the IT and Development game since the 1980’s. My first computer was a Sinclair ZX Spectrum with 48K ram. I’ve
    developed code in more than 16 different languages and scripts. I have a passion for software development, designing
    and delivering the right software in time with as little defects as possible. Always sought to look at the most cutting
    edge of technology. From the very beginning, modifying an IBM Brother XT PC into the fastest PC around. I’ve seen tech
    come and go and I’ve forgotten somethings others have not yet event learnt. I am a manager and Senior Developer at IQ
    Business.
