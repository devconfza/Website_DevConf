<h3>Brewing beer using Android Things by Riaan Cornelius</h3>

<p>While some home brewers consider automation to somehow make your brewing less “real”, part of the reason I brew is because
    I get to make stuff (I also happen to like beer).</p>

<p>In this talk I’ll very briefly go through the beer brewing process and explain what requirements I came up with for my project.</p>

<p>Then I’ll give you a very brief introduction into clean architecture before diving into how I used it to make my Android
    Things project simple, testable and extendable.</p>

<p>Along the way I’ll show you how you can run your IOT project on an emulator to help with debugging as well as testing.</p>

<h4>About the speaker</h4>

<p>Riaan is Technical Lead who develops mobile apps for Discovery by day and tries to find ridiculously interesting projects
    to tinker with by night.</p>

<p>His decade of work experience includes setting up an SMS service for USAID in Afghanistan, consulting on a mobile CRM system
    in Costa Rica and helping out with systems for an SMS campaign during presidential elections in Zambia.</p>

<p>In his spare time he likes to tinker with computer vision, robotics and home automation projects. There has been rumours
    of an obsession with all things beer related as well. This has led to talks on using Sci-fi interfaces as inspiration,
    using computer vision to keep physical and electronic scrum boards in sync, getting started with robotics using Javascript
    and building your own keyboard.</p>

<h3>Your job is not to write code by Arjun Khoosal</h3>

<p>You may assume that software engineers are hired to write code. But this definition is too narrow to accommodate software
    engineers who are good at their job. Good in what sense? Well, the only sense that makes sense: good at helping their
    company succeed. And for a company to succeed, it must solve problems for its users. And so, we have it: good software
    engineers are good at solving user problems. Slinging code is but one tool to solve these problems. Getting stuck there
    does not bode well for your users, for your company, and for you.</p>

<h4>About the speaker</h4>

<p>Arjun loves writing code. So much so that he dropped out of university, to get his fix by founding a startup. That startup
    became kandua.com - a marketplace for home services that has brought millions of rands to little tradespeople, with investors
    in 3 countries.</p>

<h3>Why shipping pet projects is so important by Simon Stewart</h3>

<p>This talk is a continuation of a series of talks I gave several years ago on the “importance of pet projects”. The intention
    is to encourage experimentation and fun outside of the day-to-day project work without promoting burn out. It will also
    highlight the potential for exposure - both from a marketing point of view and career.</p>

<p>The idea is not to push people to overwork outside of normal office hours, but instead to show the audience that we all have
    a fantastic skill and can use that to have fun with exposure being a nice potential side effect.</p>
