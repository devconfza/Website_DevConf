<h3>Brewing beer using AndroidThings by Riaan Cornelius</h3>

<p>While some home brewers consider automation to somehow make your brewing less ‚Äúreal‚Äù, part of the reason I brew is because I get to make stuff (I also happen to like beer).</p>

<p>In this talk I‚Äôll very briefly go through the beer brewing process and explain what requirements I came up with for my project.</p>

<p>Then I‚Äôll give you just enough knowledge about the hardware to follow along before diving into how I architected the AndroidThings project to keep the code simple, testable and extendable.</p>

<p>Along the way I‚Äôll sprinkle in a liberal amount of tips to help with debugging as well as warning of things that will release the magic smoke from your newly purchased hardware.</p>

<h3>Let the magic happen by Arjun Khoosal</h3>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shooting for the moon, with bottle rockets as boosters‚Äù.</p>

<p>That was the first piece of feedback our startup received, 3 years ago. We had 1 developer (me), who had never written commercial code, chasing an idea that had already been conceived, attempted, and failed, dozens of times before. It was a justifiable comment.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve certainly not landed on the moon yet. But, we have lift off. Our marketplace has done over R10m in transactions, by connecting homeowners with 100‚Äôs of artisans in Gauteng.</p>

<p>You‚Äôve heard similar stories from startups around the world.</p>

<p>A lot, from a little. How does it happen?</p>

<p>One common theme for almost all burgeoning startups, is the autonomy given to each developer.</p>

<p>To product owners and BA‚Äôs in bigger organisations, with tomes full of horror stories of devs veering off track into the abyss, this might seem idealistic or even suicidal.</p>

<p>In this talk, I‚Äôll discuss how, by hiring the right developers and giving them full business context of the problem they are solving, this fear can be mitigated, and the magic can happen.</p>

<p>At least, that‚Äôs how it will seem from the outside. But all it is, is a team of developers who care about the customer and the product, with all the creative freedom they need to build something great.   </p>

<h4>About the speaker</h4>

<p>Arjun was a Masters student who was getting along nicely: bursary, scholarship, triple major, distinction, 300+ citations, 1000+ hours of Dota 2.</p>

<p>But, wanting to build something that felt real, and useful to everyone, he dropped out to found idwork.co.za.</p>

<p>After a long grind, eventually they got users.
Then, they got revenue. 
Then, they got inspiring teamies. 
Then, they got awards. 
Then, they got a toasted-cheese maker that can process 12 slices in parallel. Then, they got investors from 3 countries. 
Then they got a new name: Kandua.com, which people could remember, for a change.</p>

<p>Now, as a team of 10 people, they're bringing millions of rands to 100's of small tradespeople; many of which have never used the internet before. And Arjun's having the time of his life üòÑ.</p>

<h3>Why shipping pet projects is so important  by Simon Stewart</h3>

<p>This talk is a continuation of a series of talks I gave several years ago on the ‚Äúimportance of pet projects‚Äù. The intention is to encourage experimentation and fun outside of the day-to-day project work without promoting burn out. It will also highlight the potential for exposure - both from a marketing point of view and career.</p>

<p>The idea is not to push people to overwork outside of normal office hours, but instead to show the audience that we all have a fantastic skill and can use that to have fun with exposure being a nice potential side effect.</p>
