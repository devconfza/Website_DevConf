<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>
    In this talk, I’ll take a deeper dive into graphing, what it can do, where to use it and where not to. Allowing you to add
    it to the tools you already have in your toolbox. We’ll take a look at graphs and the tooling in today’s world that allows
    us to make use of graphs in different ways. I’ll be doing a lot of demo’s along the way. Talk outline:
    <ul>
        <li>What is a graph and where did it come from. Graphs are not a new concept but why should I care about them.</li>
        <li>We’ll take a look at where graphs are used and what types of problems they solve.</li>
        <li>GraphQL: Facebook’s mobile apps have been powered by GraphQL since 2012. A GraphQL spec was open sourced in 2015.

            request, GraphiQL - A powerful developer tool, Evolving you API without versions, Limitations.</li>
        <li>DGraph: A database built for graphs that uses GraphQL for a query language. We’ll take a look at DGraph as a solution
