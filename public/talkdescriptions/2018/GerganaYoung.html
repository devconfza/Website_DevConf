<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>Experience the excitement of the physical web with me and BB-8, the Star Wars app enabled droid. This little robot comes with an Android and iOS app so that you can control it with your phone. However, we should not just settle for an app provided by others when we have the knowledge and tools to create our own. The idea of the physical web has created a disturbance in the force. With just a simple web page, we can now connect to “smart” devices using technologies such as Bluetooth and WiFi. The ability to do this, will soon be a standard in all new operating systems and browsers. This means that we will no longer be limited by our phone or tablet or the version of an operating system we are running. Join me and BB-8 as we explore all the opportunities that the physical web can provide for this little droid. We will build a website, deploy it and control our little droid. With only a smart device connected to the internet you, the audience, will be able to find the droid you are looking for.</p>
