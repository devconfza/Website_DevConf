<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>With this talk I would like to discuss what a full stack developer is and how this can lead us to be better at our craft.
    This is not just a definition, but a dedication and conscious decision for any developer to become good at what they
    do. For a junior to become involved in all aspects of a team, they have to go through a journey. A journey that involves
    different technologies, methods and experiences that make people's lives easier with our code. Is this not what programming
    is all about?</p>
