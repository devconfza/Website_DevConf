<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>What does it mean to be a “professional” software developer?  It means a lot more than just writing code for money.

 

    At Chillisoft we have been discussing what this means over the past few years, and we have even taken it to the point where we have started up a School of Professional Software Development, called DevFluence.
    
     
    
    We sum up the status of being a professional software developer in this phrase:
    
     
    
    "The courage to create value for customers, myself and my community." 
    
     
    
    In this talk, I want to explain what we mean by this phrase, and then provide some examples of young developers who are doing this. I also want to talk a bit about DevFluence and how we are trying to spread this ethos while building technical skills in South Africa.</p>
