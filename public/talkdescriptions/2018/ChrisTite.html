<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>Log files hold a vault of useful information for operations as well as business.</p>

<p>Processing your log files could reveal a host of useful information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who uses that brand new web solution you have just deployed?</li>
<li>Which country are they in?</li>
<li>What device are they using?</li>
<li>When your host is under load, what else is happening in the environment?</li>
<li>That pesky, intermittent error is back! How do you find it?</li>
<li>Our build server is slow, why?</li>
<li>Processing application and server log files used to be such a chore. Getting a unified view of all logs required wizard-like skills! But over the past few years simple and easy solutions have emerged. Best of all, they’re free. That’s right, they’re all open source!</li>
</ul>

<p>Join me for a hands-on presentation, where we’ll pull some useful open source Docker containers and set to work making them weave some magic on our log files.</p>

<p>We’ll cover some Docker Compose basics to get you started with a simple ELK stack (Elastic Search, Log Stash and Kibana), configure some endpoints and setup log shipping (for Linux and Windows) so that we can process log files.</p>

<p>Once we’re processing logs, we’ll look at ways to transform and embellish our log data to add IT operational, as well as business value.</p>

<p>Using our transformed data, we’ll also cover visualising the data using Kibana.</p>

<p>To close out we’ll also consider alternative technologies such as Prometheus and Grafana, and discuss the pros and cons of the different technologies.</p>

<p>Mining log files has never been so simple.</p>

<p>Join me to see how easy it is to get started.</p>
