<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>Since the dawn of man (And indeed, Kerbalkind), we have looked up at the moon and stars and wondered ... is there cheese out there? Seeing as how modern science has yet to answer this question sufficiently we set out to see for ourselves.</p>

<p>In spaceflight people use physical switches, dials, buttons and readouts to pilot their vessels. In the game Kerbal Space Program you use a mouse and keyboard. In order to get a more authentic experience, we set out to build a <a href="https://www.google.co.za/search?q=ksp+control+board&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5h8HHn7PTAhUMCsAKHdgyB1sQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950">KSP Control Board</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see from some of the sample pictures, a few people have managed this before. However most of it is written using C# since that is what the game is written in. Because JavaScript is awesome, we set out to use that instead.</p>

<p>There is a mod for the game called <a href="https://krpc.github.io/krpc/">KRPC</a> which allows you to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google Protocol buffers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a> to communicate with the game remotely. We wrote a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/krpc-node">node.js module</a> that can be included in any regular app. Using this module, and <a href="http://johnny-five.io/">Johnny-Five</a> we wrote a node.js script that can interface with the Arduino. The Arduino in turn interacts with the various physical switches, buttons, joysticks, sensors and a LCD. </p>

<p>In addition we wrote an auto-pilot script that is capable of doing SpaceX Falcon 9 style return to launch site mission using a script written purely in JavaScript.  </p>
