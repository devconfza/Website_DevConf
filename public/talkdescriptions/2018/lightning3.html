<h3>Create a Worthwhile Internship Programme by André Odendaal</h3>

<p>Turn school/college graduates into immediately useful junior developers by using the methods and practices we've been developing for over 4 years at the Microsoft AppFactory. We focus on mentoring experimenting to find the solution; communicating effectively about work progress and blockers; and committing to delivery as part of a team. In this presentation I want to share our practices and how you can use them in your own internship.</p>

<h3>How and why to tell strangers on the Internet about stuff you know by Riaan Nel</h3>

<p>This brief talk is about my journey into online course creation, and how anyone can share their skills, reach people all over the world, build their brand, and hopefully make some profit while they’re at it.</p>

<p>I also want to touch on what I’ve learnt about motivation, marketing, and speaking in the process.</p>

<h4>About the speaker</h4>

<p>Riaan has spent over a decade writing code for everything from ERP software to banking systems.  He is a lifelong learner and it's pretty much guaranteed that he'll be signed up to some or other course at any given time.  He once tried to start a training company, but realised that he sucks at marketing.  Consequently, he kept his day job and now he teaches online programming courses in his spare time (and leaves the marketing to someone else). <br>
He also hangs around elsewhere on the Internet:  https://twitter.com/rambling_riaan</p>

<h3>Breaking into a wireless networks with Kali Linux by Gerard de Jong</h3>

<p>In this talk we’ll explore the <a href="https://www.kali.org">Kali Linux</a> toolset and show you how to break into a WPA2 secured wireless accesspoint, live on stage.</p>

<p>First we’ll take you over how to capture a wireless client’s handshake, then we’ll show you how extract the hashed passphrase and finally how to crack that hash to reviel the passpharse itself.</p>

<p>As a side act we’ll also show you how to jam wireless networks and even target specific users.</p>

<p>You’ll will leave this talk with a deeper understanding of the problems with our current 802.11 WiFi standards, why cracking them is much harder to pull off than you would have thought, and hankering to change your WiFi password then you get home!</p>
