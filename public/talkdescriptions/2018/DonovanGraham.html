<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>The micro-services models has changed how we think about developing application services. By defining smaller clear service
    boundaries it makes it easier to build, test, deploy and isolate failures. Using a similar approach, this session shares
    how you can carry the same benefits into frontend development. Within a large application, breaking up a frontend monolith
    into micro frontends allows teams to form around solving and owning a particular feature. Teams are cross-functional
    across backend and frontend and able to operate independently of each other. They can use different languages and typically
    own the continuous delivery and ongoing maintenance of the feature in production. Micro frontend work side-by-side or
    together inside the same html page wrapper leading to a cohesive end-user experience.</p>
