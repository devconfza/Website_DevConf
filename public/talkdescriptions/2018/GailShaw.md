### About the talk

Data science is all over the news. The job of data scientist is said to be one of the fastest growing jobs. But what is data science? Is it just another name for Business Intelligence? And how does “Big Data” fit into the picture.

In this talk, I’ll take your through what Data Science is, and what it is not, and then we’ll try and solve some simple Data Science-type problems in R, Python and Azure Machine learning. Simple problems, like image recognition and fraud detection.
