<h3>Habit Driven Design by Nico Botha</h3>

<p>Usage of any tech product on a regular basis creates habits among its users. Habits are created spontaneously without the user noticing it. If these habits are not carefully thought out (and the product specifically designed to drive certain habits) user habits can get out of control. This talk will give you some insight into the concept of habit driven design (HDD). How does the products we use daily dictate our habits? Why is it important to design for specific human behavior? Come and challenge yourself as we journey into the world of user habits and software. </p>
