<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>The nature of applications is critical to what we want them to do - they can provide meaningful and even critical advantage to a business – they can connect people that were unable to connect with each other before – or provide a new and engaging way to interact with customers.  In a fair number of online businesses their ability to interpret and understand what customer are doing and how they are using these services, all comes from a deep understanding and application of insights gained from the data that is gather.  This ability and understanding is no longer the domain of Facebook and Amazons but is a necessity for all business to – understand customers better, then be able to respond appropriately and ultimately assist customers in being able to take the best advantage of what value the business has to offer.  This all has to happen at a rate and scale beyond human intervention.  Machine learning has the promise and already proves to provide a means of addressing the insights and aids in responding to customer as and when they engage.  The ability to produce effective functionally that is of value goes beyond automation and integration -it requires meaningful understanding and almost instant response to follow the flow of behaviour and usage. It requires functional response that assists humans using these applications.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>

<p>I have been involved with custom application development in the Microsoft environment for over 20 years. I helped start a company called Shandon in 2000 in the middle of the IT dry spell which followed Y2K. The motivation for starting the business was to take advantage of the immerging opportunities that the Internet was providing businesses, by meaningfully interacting and transacting with customers.  We learnt a lot very quickly and had our fair share of solutions end up on the ash heap.  Learning from our mistakes was as important as the projects that succeeded.  We have been very fortunate to have worked on projects in a number of industries from property management, banking, credit bureaus to name a few.  The pinnacle of our efforts has been the opportunity to be part of an online solution that has affected how people submit and pay their taxes in South Africa.
