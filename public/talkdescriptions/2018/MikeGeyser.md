### About the talk

The holy grail of web applications is having them be near-native performance, and to a large degree this has driven the JavaScript revolution. To truly realise that goal we need to embrace native design thinking for our applications, applying it not only to our code but also to our content. Using ideas from Progressive Web Applications and a modern framework such as Angular we can create engaging, fast and available application experiences - the best of both native and web.

This code-oriented talk will show how to practically use select principles of Progressive Web Applications in conjunction with Angular to create fast and compelling web experiences. It will cover the creation of an application shell and go into using service workers for preloading, caching and even offline support.

### About the speaker

Mike Geyser is a programmer at BBD in the R&D team, co-organiser of the Jozi.JS meetup group, a frequent technical speaker, and loves the web. He has been hacking on it since Geocities was a thing, and has the keening wail of dialup modem etched into his subconscious. While he is fluent in several ‘golden hammer’ programming languages, he has a long-lived love affair with JavaScript, and cannot see its (many, obvious) flaws. He has worked on lots of interesting enterprise applications, but it is the challenges of the public web that really appeal to him - having spent his formative years building transactional websites. He is always eager to talk about the web platform, but be warned, he is prone to hyperbole.
