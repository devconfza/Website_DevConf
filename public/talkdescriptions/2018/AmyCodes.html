<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration today. However beginner-level educational content
    to learn Kubernetes today is still focused on cluster management through the Kubernetes CLI tool. This can make it harder
    for novices to visualize the relationship between the commands they’re issuing and what’s happening in the cluster. Incrementally
    building a Helm Chart provides an easier, more intuitive, and more visual way of learning the key concepts of Kubernetes,
    while addressing how to manage package releases upfront.
</p>

<p>This talk will cover how to incrementally build a Helm Chart for NGINX, and along the way, will cover key Kubernetes concepts.
    Content will include as many diagrams and visuals as possible to accompany these concepts, and include how to deploy
    the new NGINX chart from a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
