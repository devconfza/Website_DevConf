<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, started working in agile software development teams together, and had happy
    relationships because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in. (They
    forgot that they were from different planets.) Based on years of successful counselling of software developers and testers,
    Software Developers Are from Mars; Testers are from Venus has helped one team (somewhere) transform their relationships.
    Now viewed as a tongue-in-cheek talk on modern software development, this phenomenal discussion has helped software developers
    and testers realise how different they are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn't occur
    and relationships are given a chance to grow.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>

<p>I'm the head of SQA Architecture and R&D at DVT and love seeing screens flickering away with automation scripts. Weekends
    are spent on my extreme makeover DIY house project. I am a dreamer with my head in the clouds most of the time, and I
    absolutely love software testing! </p>
