<h3>About the speaker</h3>

<p>My motto is: "find what you love doing and you'll never work a day in your life" and true to my motto I have found my love.
    I am an improvement ambassador. I am an agile evangelist, I have faith in the methodology because I live and breathe
    it. No task is too large or complex for me. I am analytical, meticulous, driven and will always rise to any challenge.
    Currently I am the Principal Atlassian Consultant for Obsidian Systems, managing a team of great Atlassian Consultants
    and have been living my dream of "love what you do" for the last three years. Prior to this, I was a Development Operations
    Manager for various companies for approximately 6 years. I live, breathe, walk and talk Agile and Atlassian. I am a certified
    Scrum Master and Agile Practitioner and love nothing more than to step into companies and assist them in their Agile
    journey. I am passionate about breaking down silos that companies put up over time. I am passionate about bringing together
    developers, IT Ops and management so that all processes are streamlined to better work together to get features out faster.
    I do not believe there is only one way to fix a solution, it all depends on what you find when you step into a company's
    dynamics, but there are tools out there that are geared for the DevOps journey. It is not always a cookie cutter in the
    making, and often times there are a lot of tears, but when they all buy into the dream, that's when magic happens...</p>
