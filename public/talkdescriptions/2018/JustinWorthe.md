### About the talk

Hi, I’m Justin, and I play the trumpet. I’m a software engineer, bad musician, and chronic yak shaver, so when I discovered that my intonation was bad while playing the trumpet the obvious solution was to start programming. The idea was to have an application listen to me playing and give feedback on my pitch. This application is written in my current favourite programming language, Rust, and so my Rusty Microphone project was started.

Now that I have something that works, I’m looking at ways to make my application available to the world, especially to musicians. Musicians are not widely known for their ability to clone a git repository, assemble the necessary collection of libraries and compilers on their computer, and compile things, so I went looking for distribution methods.

As someone who spends his working hours building web applications, I’ve seen many cases of web applications that have been packaged as if they’re a smartphone or desktop application. What if I tried the reverse, and packaged my desktop application for the web? With Rust’s support for WebAssembly, this should be easy, right?

This is the story of me taking my Rust application and figuring out how to embed it in my website.

### About the speaker

Justin is a software engineer, working on both sides of the Internet
in the web development stack. This has resulted in a considerable
amount of JavaScript. In his spare time, he likes to tinker with lower
level languages and concepts, which has lead to his current
fascination with Rust.

Wherever possible, Justin prefers to use free and open source
software. He also tries to give back to these amazing online
ecosystems by writing about what he's up on his blog, including code
examples with open source licences for others to use and learn from.

His pug is not currently plotting world domination. Everything is fine.
