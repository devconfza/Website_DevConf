### About the talk

Like it or not, things will always go wrong in production. Rouan is going to tell you about the types of issues that you should expect. He’ll show you a range of techniques for finding out quickly that something has gone wrong, including everything from automated alerting to an old-fashioned phone call from a grumpy user.

Rouan will also cover diagnostic tools that can help you figure out what went wrong, talk about how your team could approach issues, and explain the possibility of creating self-healing mechanisms. Lastly, he’ll chat about what you need to ship a fix fast and how the right production monitoring can even help you write less code.

After attending the talk, you’ll see that production issues are learning opportunities. You’ll be ready to spot them, understand them and use them to build better software.
