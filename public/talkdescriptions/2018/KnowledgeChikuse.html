<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>What is the cost of our culture's addiction to software? How much fuel is needed to produce enough power to keep that docker
    container running? I'm no bunny-hugger, but I'll share some of my research and conclusions on a cause many of us don't
    think about - the environmental impact from our insatiable need for software, and what we as developers can do to help.
    Don't miss it.</p>

<h3>About the speaker</h3>

<p>'m a dedicated software developer at DVT and tend to focus on Java \ DevOps during working hours. On weekends I enjoy catching
    some fresh air by hiking or pottering in the garden. When I'm not getting my hands dirty, I spend my time reflecting
    on the nature of software and our complex world.</p>
