<h3>About the talk</h3>

<p>The tech landscape is changing faster than ever, and this trend is only accelerating. How do technical people grow when the
    world is changing faster than you can finish your next cup of coffee? How does one keep up? What should you learn? Are
    there things we can focus our learning efforts on besides just the next tech flavour of the month? This talk will explore
    some areas of learning that technical people might not intentionally consider. These areas focus on higher-level concerns,
    with slower rates of change, which can help technical people develop into more well-rounded individuals.</p>
