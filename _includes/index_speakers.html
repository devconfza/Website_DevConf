						          "Teaching Computers to be as Flawed as Humans Through Algorithmic Bias"
Earlier this year, NPR did a story answering the question, can computers be racist? (Yes.) Not soon after, Microsoft launched an AI chatbot experiment, called Tay, which shut down when the software began spewing hateful speech on Twitter. One of the knowns fears of AI and machine learning is the notion of algorithmic bias, which can create or indirectly allow machines to learn prejudiced behavior. In this talk, we will explore what it really means to “teach” a computer to have prejudices, and what this can mean for the future of computing.

What Attendees Can Expect to Learn: Examples of “bad” computing, how personal beliefs and prejudice can manifest in code, and ways to avoid personal bias in algorithms."
