    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>Who runs DevConf?</h2>
    <p>DevConf is owned by the non-profit organisation <a href="https://www.developerug.org.za">The Developer Group</a>.
        DevConf is run by two of the DevUG directors in their free time, Candice Herodotou and Robert MacLean.</p>
    <h2>What is the goal of DevConf?</h2>
    <p>DevConf has a simple goal: give professional software engineers an opportunity to network and learn from their
        peers in a safe environment.</p>
    <h2>Can I buy without a credit card? OR I need an invoice to buy for work?</h2>
    <p>Totally! You have two choices available for you:</p>
    <h3>Buy online</h3>
    <p>We support buying with EFT online and you have 24 hours to pay. Once you have reserved your tickets, if you
        login to the ticketing website you can generate an invoice for your company.</p>
    <h3>Manual purchase</h3>
    <p>We have a manual process too, where you can <a href="mailto:info@devconf.co.za">email us</a> all the relevant
        company details (VAT number, name, PO number etc...) and we can generate a manual invoice for you to pay.</p>
    <h2>Can I have a free ticket?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately not. DevConf is designed to be cash neutral so we do not have any excess funds to sponsor free
        tickets. We do work with sponsors on processes for them to donate tickets, so follow us on social media to hear
        about those opportunities when they come up.</p>
    <h2>I would like to speak at the event!</h2>
    <p>That is awesome! We have a call for papers each year in August. You can get the details of this when
        you signup on our mailing list.</p>
    <h2>Who is Fizz Marketing?</h2>
    <p>Fizz is our planning and logistics partner and handles the administrative duties for DevConf.</p>
    <h2>How did this start?</h2>
    <p>The idea of DevConf originated with Robert MacLean in late 2013; the idea was to run an event for developers who
        could not attend the Developer User Group which happened outside of normal working hours. The first DevConf
        happened in 2016. DevConf is proudly run by Candice Herodotou and Robert MacLean.</p>
    <h2>How much money do you make?</h2>
    <p>Nothing. DevConf is designed to be cash neutral so there is no profit or loss made. DevConf has made a small
        profit each year (which is better than a loss) and that profit has been used to fund the following year as well
        as put into the Developer User Group.</p>
    <p>In 2016, some profit was used to fund trips to other 2 conferences to learn from those conferences and a UHK
        keyboard bought
        for each of the organisers (3 that year) as a gift at a cost of less than R10 000. Since 2016, the organisers
        have not taken any funds out directly or indirectly.</p>
