            <h2>What is the goal of DevConf?</h2>
            <p>DevConf has a simple goal: give professional software developers an opportunity to network and learn from
                their
                peers in a safe environment.</p>

            <h2>Can I buy tickets without a credit card? Is it possible to generate an invoice for comapnies?</h2>
            <p>Totally! There are two options available to you:</p>
            <h3>Buy online</h3>
            <p>Our online ticketing solution supports both credit cards and EFT options. If purchasing by EFT online,
                the
                ticketing platform reserves your tickets for 24 hours to allow time for the EFT to reflect. Once the
                purchase is
                confirmed, you can log in to the ticketing website to generate an invoice for your company.</p>
            <h3>Manual purchase</h3>
            <p>We have a manual process too, where you can <a href="mailto:info@devconf.co.za">email us</a> all the
                relevant
                company details (VAT number, name, PO number etc...) and we will generate a manual invoice for you to
                pay.</p>

            <h2>Can I have a free ticket?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately not. DevConf is designed to be cash neutral so we do not have any excess funds to sponsor
                free
                tickets. Only speakers and organisers receive complementary access to the event. We do work with
                sponsors on
                processes for them to donate tickets, so follow us on social media to hear about those opportunities
                when they
                come up.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>I would like to speak at the event!</h2>
            <p>That is awesome! We have a call for speakers each year You can get the details of this when
                you sign up to our mailing list.</p>

            <h2>How did this start?</h2>
            <p>The idea of DevConf originated with Robert MacLean in late 2013; the idea was to run an event for
                developers who
                could not attend the Developer User Group which happened outside of normal working hours. The first
                DevConf
                took place in 2016. DevConf is proudly run by Candice Herodotou and Robert MacLean.</p>

            <h2>How much money do you make?</h2>
            <p>Nothing. DevConf is designed to be cash neutral so there is no profit nor loss, however, DevConf has made
                a small
                surplus each year (which is better than a loss) and that surplus has been used to fund the following
                year as
                well as cover some of the community initiatives run by the Developer User Group. Where possible (budget- and space-permitting), those DevUG committee members who are not involved with DevConf planning are allocated one non-transferrable ticket each to attend DevConf.</p>
            <p>In 2016, some of this surplus funded trips for two organisers to attend other conferences with the
                intention of
                learning from those events, and a UHK keyboard was bought for each of the organisers (3 that year) as a
                gift at
                a cost of less than R10 000. In 2021, the organisers bought two laptops to replace aging equipment used
                to run
                the eventd. The organisers have not recieved any other financial benefits.</p>

            <h2>Is the event auditted?</h2>
            <p>Yes, DevConf is audited each year after the events. The Developer User Group is also audited annually and
                is
                fully compliant with SARS and CIPC.</p>
