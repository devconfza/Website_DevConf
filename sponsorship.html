            <p>Dear Potential Sponsor, </p>
            <p>DevConf, the conference for professional South African software engineers, is now in its fifth year of
                planning, aiming to bring together the entire local software engineer community for a full day of
                in-depth discussions in two cities. DevConf 2020 is aiming to reach over 1250 developers.</p>
            <p>By providing the right sponsorship platforms, we aim to work with our sponsors in providing delegates
                with further event benefits such as networking, career discussions and opportunities.</p>
            <p>What’s new in the DevConf 2020 sponsorship packages? We are excited to launch new stands which we feel
                will improve the look and feel of the networking space and also help differentiate between the different
                sponsor levels. Furthermore with the continued effort to provide a eco-friendly event, we have
                introduced
                branded water bottles and will be placing water coolers on the top tier sponsor to attract delegates to
                these stands.
                In addition we will adding laptop stickers for the top tier partners. We have also increased the
                discount
                to purchase additional tickets from 10% to 12.5% so that our valued sponsors can send more of their team
                to
                be part of the experience!</p>
            <p>For 2020 we are also going to be rewarding the best rated sponsor by offering them an 8% discount on all
                their 2021 sponsorship packages.</p>
            <p>What isn't changing for DevConf 2020 is the price! We are very excited to announce that all sponsorship
                packages are staying at their 2019 price or have been lowered.</p>
            <p>It goes without saying that DevConf 2020 simply wouldn’t be possible without the support of our valued
                sponsors.
                As in previous years, we hope to see many of our returning sponsors and hope to welcome new sponsors
                onboard to provide our delegates with an even greater experience in 2020.</p>
            <p>We look forward to working with you!</p>
