<p>Git is an amazingly useful and powerful tool. 
	Continuous Integration and (Continuous deployments) are incredibly valuable practices.</p>

	<p>But are they compatible? </p>

<p>How do Git's major advantages such as cheap branching fly in the face of continuous integration?
	Is there a way to use the popular Git-Flow process and still have true CI?</p>

<p>I would like to explore my journey into using Git and CI thoughout my career, and I'll cover the various lessons learnt and viewpoints held and how they have changed.
	I'm not promising to have a solution to the problems posed, but I would like to stir up some debate and get people to think about their processes rather than just following practices that seem to be buzzwords.</p>
