When working in a team environment, code-reviews are an essential step in the process of producing code. Reviewing code decreases “silos” by increasing mutual understanding, exposes bugs/pitfalls and allows you to maintain consistency and quality. I’ll be sharing some of my experiences with the Zando team, how we work and the tools we use.

<ul>
	<li>Learn how to conduct productive and critical code-reviews</li>
	<li>Behaviours to encourage and discourage in code-reviews</li>
	<li>Habits to develop in your team to lead to fewer defects in production</li>
</ul>
