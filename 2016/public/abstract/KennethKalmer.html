	<p>Take your CI server from good to great! I'll share some examples of graduating your CI from tester, merger, deployer into a productive member of the team.</p>

	<p>CI servers can:</p>
	<p>* Run static analysis tools to guide refactorings and enforce team standards</p>
	<p>* Upgrade dependencies (local and external) and run tests, catching breaking changes early</p>
	<p>* Check for security vulnerabilities, in the app and dependencies (CVE's)</p>
	<p>* Build with stricter configurations to catch other issues</p>
	<p>* Run any other repeatable process that would be mundane for good developers, freeing them to focus on the 10x stuff</p>
