<p>Design thinking is a methodology used by designers to create innovative and effective solutions. 
Most scientific methodologies of working take all the known factors into account when deriving a 
solution, whereas, design thinking analyses both the known and the unknown. It challenges us to 
delve deeper into the problem and read between the lines before forming a solution. This talk aims 
to provide insight into activities and practices that assist developers in building effective, 
	robust, and usable software by utilising the design thinking methodology.</p>

<p>The outcome of this talk is to highlight the benefits for the developer, team, client, and project 
in being a design thinker. It is to also convey some practices that the audience can immediately 
	apply in their working lives to better themselves and their projects.</p>
