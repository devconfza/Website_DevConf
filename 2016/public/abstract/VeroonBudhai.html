<p>In this session I will discuss the importance of analytics in the application life cycle and how to use
it to drive change that improves the end users' experience of applications.
This includes how to define meaningful metrics to measure so that the data being used to inform decisions
	is accurate and reflects the actual usage of the system.</p>

<p>I will be showing attendees Google Tag Manager(GTM) with Google Analytics(GA), as an example of tag managers
and why they should be using them instead of implementing analytics tags straight into their applications.
The techniques for that I'll discuss can be used for other tag managers, like Omniture,
	but I chose GTM since it's free to use so attendees can start playing around with it straight away.</p>
