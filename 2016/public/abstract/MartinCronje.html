	<p>10 people delivering more than a department of 150. How is that possible? </p>

	<p>In his work as a coach the speaker has seen how small nimble software teams outperform large enterprise teams by a factor of 10 to 1 or more. This talk explores the causes this phenomenon and how to effectively scale software development.</p>

	<p>Scaling software development is usually driven by a need for teams to deliver more features with increasing complexity faster. Typically companies address this need by increasing team size without considering others factors that affect a teamâ€™s ability to deliver.</p>

	<p>In this talk the speaker will explore characteristics that enables teams to scale their software development capacity without growing headcount. This talk will use model and simulations of value streams to visualise explore factors such as batch sizes, process overheard, feature selection and scoping, defect management, team size, team organisation, capacity management, and task switching.</p>

	<p>The speaker will look at how modern software development practices that has an effect on these factors. (such as TDD, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Story Mapping, Pair and Mob programming)</p>
