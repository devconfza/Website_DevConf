	<p>Becoming the next Uber is only possible when bringing your ideas faster to your end users. Some aspects of DevOps are perfect for that as it only works if Ops and Dev work closely together. But what does this mean for you as a developers? Delivering code faster with the high chance of failing faster?</p>

	<p>In my opinion we need to look at Key Technical Metrics such as Memory Usage per User or Request, # of SQLs, # of Service Calls, Transferred Bytes, ... - these are metrics you need to track starting at your workstation all the way through CI into Ops – and don’t forget the Business: How often is the new feature really used? What does it cost to run it? Let these metrics act as Quality Gateways and stop builds early before they Crash your System: faster than ever.</p>

	<p>In this session we look at how companies like Facebook, CreditOne and Co apply metric-driven DevOps. We look at use cases that crashed rapid deployments, identify metrics that identify the reason of the crash and learn how to use these metrics to steer your pipeline to build better code, deploy faster, without failing faster! </p>
