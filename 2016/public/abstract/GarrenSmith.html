People are using our web applications on mobile devices, so internet connectivity is no longer always guaranteed.
We need to build applications that work offline. Enter PouchDB, a database that works in the browser and
CouchDB, a NoSql database that replicates. Combine both of these and you can build responsive applications that work whether
the user is online or offline. In this talk I will introduce both of these great database technologies,
show you how to get started with CouchDB and PouchDB, and demo many ways you can combine them for an amazing web experience for your users.
