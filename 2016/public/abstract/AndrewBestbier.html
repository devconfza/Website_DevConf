I plan to give a high level overview of React.Js to the audience, so that they will feel comfortable with the general concepts and know how to get started. Many people would have heard of React.Js and will want to know what all the fuss is about. This talk will give a brief outline of the history of React.Js, why it is incredibly useful and the problems it solves. I will give brief code examples (showing the outline of a React.Js component), but will not go in-depth. I will however provide links to many websites that give in-depth tutorials and will also provide a boilerplate Github repository for interested listeners to pursue further.
