<p>We're stuck in limbo with angularjs 1.x, knowing that v2 is looming large on the horizon - with
significant changes, but no clear upgrade path. In this session we'll focus on some of the major
design flaws of angular 1, the reasons behind the change, and work through how to best future-proof
your code. Even if angular 2 doesn't become a 'thing', we can make our angular 1 code the best it
	could be.</p>

	<p>Major changes between angular 1 and angular 2</p>
	<p>How to avoid the biggest angular 1 performance pitfalls</p>
	<p>How to structure and partition angular applications for development at scale (both amount of functionality and team size).</p>
	<p>How to start preparing existing angular applications for v2</p>
