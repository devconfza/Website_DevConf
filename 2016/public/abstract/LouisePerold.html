	<p>In 1961, in his chapter about testing in his book "Computer Programming Fundamentals", Jerry Weinberg wrote - "It is, of course, difficult to have the machine check how well the program matches the intent of the programmer without giving a great deal of information about that intent. If we had some simple way of presenting that kind of information to the machine for checking, we might just as well have the machine do the coding. Let us not forget that complex logical operations occur through a combination of simple instructions executed by the computer and not by the computer logically deducing or inferring what is desired."</p>

<p>Are you testing if you have a set of automated tests that you consistently run? Do you need a human doing testing? Why bother testing at all?
	In this session, I would like to discuss and debate what 'Testing' means to people. </p>
