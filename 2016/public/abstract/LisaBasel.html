<p>Developers often feel de-motivated, disempowered and under-utilized. Especially if working in big 
	teams or in big corporations.</p>

<p>I want to help developers identify where these feelings come from and give them ideas on how to 
adjust their behaviour and mind-set. Itâ€™s not easy to change other people or organisations, but it is 
	possible to change your own behaviour and attitude.</p>

	<p>Very often when we change ourselves, others respond and follow. </p>

<p>However I believe that the developers are not aware of how significant an impact they personally 
can have on the success of a team and the software created. I want to share my pragmatic opinions, 
	ideas and tools that technical people can use to improve their job satisfaction.</p>

<p>However I believe that the developers and testers are not aware of how significant an impact they 
personally can have on the success of a team and the software created. There are so many ways that 
	they can influence and lead even as a junior or new member of a team. </p>
