	<p>Building extraordinary user experience requires extraordinary capabilities. Among these capabilities, persistence of data is one of the most important one. We need a database that is fast, scalable and supported by world-class infrastructure, has a wide-variety of APIs, allows for clean code and needs less coding.</p>

	<p>FireBase, Google's NoSQL cloud database, provides just that. Auto-scale to millions of users; real-time user experience; easy-to-use APIs. It allows developers to build extraordinary mobile and web apps. With FireBase, you can build and build fast for any device. FireBase also supports REST API natively. This session will be focussed on providing a practical overview of this awesome database with coding examples.</p>
