I am a technhical lead and part-time trainer at BBD. I'm currently drifting around in the banking space. I have been a developer for the last 15 years and hold an MEng from Wits. When I'm not working or trying my hand at something new in the technology world I like to run. I'm currently training for my first Comrades marathon this year.

I am part of the Jozi-Jug committee and presented 2 talks at the JUG last year, one on Swagger and the other one on the value of certifications. I also present the Java expert level certification training at BBD.
