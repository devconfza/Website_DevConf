	<p>Having loved computer science at school I realised that software development was my calling; I moved on to complete my B.Sc. HONS Computer science at UCT (long before #feesmustfall).</p>

	<p>I have been working with C# for last 11 years, moving from front end development focused on Windows forms to back end development services and now slightly begrudgingly towards web (but mainly the services behind the scenes).</p>
	
	<p>Moving from 5 years of working in the "casino world" and the 100% uptime that comes with it, I moved to JAG Method to help revolutionise their IT systems. JAG Method is one of SA's largest online lead generators. We specialise in generating leads for the financial services industry (no we are not those SPAMMER guys!).</p>

	<p>Adopting an unproven service bus based design our small team has rewritten the 10,000 line one-file VB service (sexy!) into a multi-service, service bus oriented system with full management portal and monitoring (scary!). We currently process between 4000 and 8000 leads a day which are received, cleaned, run through a rules engine and then send on to the insurers for conversion.</p>
