	<p>Software developer. Conference Speaker & Coach. Not a rockstar/ninja/pirate/guru. Interested in learning and sharing experiences. I've been a developing software for just over a decade now and in that time learned that software development is more about people than code. Although the code is fun, the people aspect is so much more important.</p>
