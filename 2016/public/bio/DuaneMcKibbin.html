	<p>My name is Duane McKibbin. I have been a software developer for 10 years working in various fields.</p>

	<p>I started in Machine to machine communications (IOT before it was a buzzword ;) ) at Siemens, writing embedded j2me software as well as the corresponding j2ee server code.</p>

<p>I then worked at a startup developing an electrical smart grid system aimed at preventing load shedding. My main responsibility was a handheld device used for field installations (.net compact framework), 
	but I helped out on the Java server side as well. I dipped my toes into some embedded C++ but nothing much to speak of.</p>

	<p>I now work at Entelect Software as a Team Lead. I am currently based at Ashburton Investments but previously worked on various projects in various industries including medical aid, debt consolodation and imports.</p>

<p>I have a real passion for web development, particularly front end javascript applications. I also attempt to blog at www.continuousdeveloper.co.za, where I talk mainly about CI and Continuous delivery, though I have
	fallen a bit behind lately. I love to share my knowledge with other developers and am always keen to learn something new.</p>

	<p>I have previously presented internal training forums within Entelect as well as at our internal DevDay conference. This would be my first foray into speaking in the wider community.</p>

	<p>On a personal note, I am married and have a 1 year old daughter who keeps me very busy when I'm not in the office.</p>
