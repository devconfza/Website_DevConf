	<p>I'm a software developer who develops mobile apps for Discovery by day and tries to find ridiculously interesting projects to tinker with by night. </p>

	<p>My decade of work experience includes setting up an SMS service for USAID in Afghanistan, consulting on a mobile CRM system in Costa Rica and helping out with systems for an SMS campaign during presidential elections in Zambia. </p>

	<p>My tinkering has included computer vision, robotics and home automation projects. This has led to talks on using Sci-fi interfaces as inspiration, using computer vision to keep physical and electronic scrum boards in sync and getting started with robotics using Javascript.</p>

	<p>However, what I am really passionate about is producing quality code. I'm always looking for better ways to refactor legacy code.</p>
