is	his	strongest	skill	in	his	bag	of	many	and	varied	tricks.	With	over	15	years	of	
experience,	mainly	in	financial	systems,	he	is	focused	on	solving	the	right	problems,	the	
right	way.	A	co-organiser	of	the	Joburg	Software	Testers	meetup,	Oz	loves	to	interact,	
learn	and	grow	with	the	community.	He	enjoys	a	good	coffee,	especially	with	developers	
and	other	non	testers	alike. He has spoken at Agile Africa 2015, and co-facilitated a workshop at Lets Test Conference South Africa.
