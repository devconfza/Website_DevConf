    <p><strong>Ticket Purchasing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Tickets are sold on behalf of DevUG by Quicket or Fizz Marketing. Do not purchase tickets from any source other
        than these two authorised agencies.&nbsp;Tickets purchased from any other source may be unauthorised copies and
        may be refused admittance to the conference. All fees become payable at the time the booking for the conference
        is made. If this fee remains unpaid at the time of the conference, you may be denied entry to the conference or
        workshop, with no reduction in your liability to pay the fee. For manual ticket bookings through Fizz Marketing,
        tickets will only be reserved for 3 weeks from the date of invoice sent. Should payment not be received by the
        deadline the tickets will be released. The cut off for manual ticket bookings through Fizz Marketing is two
        weeks before the event date. Look after your ticket(s) as you would cash. It must be presented to gain
        admittance to the conference.&nbsp;The code on the ticket uniquely identifies this ticket and the purchaser and
        can be redeemed only once. Multiple copies of this ticket will not allow multiple entries.&nbsp;If multiple
        copies of this code are presented at the conference, Dev UG and its authorised agencies may refuse entry to all
        ticket holders presenting tickets with this code.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Transfers, Cancellations and Refunds&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>In the event of the conference being cancelled, the purchase will be refunded via the same payment method with
        which the original purchase was made within 3 weeks. In the event of a postponement, purchased tickets for the
        original date will be valid for the new date unless otherwise notified. Purchasers have the option to seek a
        refund for the value of the purchased ticket(s) for a postponed event by&nbsp;<a
            href="mailto:info@devconf.co.za" target="_blank">contacting us&nbsp;</a>after the announcement of the new
        conference date. In the event of the refund being authorised for a postponed event, the refund will be processed
        via the same payment method with which the original purchase was made within 3 weeks. If you have booked for the
        conference and are unable to attend, you may transfer your ticket to another person by logging into Quicket and
        updating the ticket details not less than 72 before the conference. &nbsp;To cancel a booking for a conference,
        please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@devconf.co.za" target="_blank">email us</a>. A full refund can only be provided
        if notice is received at least 45 days before the event. A&nbsp;50% refund is offered if notice is received at
        least 15 days before the event. A&nbsp;25% refund is offered if notice is received at least 5 days before the
        event, after which no refund will be issued. These timelines apply for the original event date, and if the event
        is postponed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a medical reason for not being able to attend, please&nbsp;<a
            href="mailto:info@devconf.co.za" target="_blank">email us</a>&nbsp;the doctors note, and we will convert
        this ticket to a virtual event ticket. Medical refunds can only be applied for on a per person basis and as such
        bulk bookings cannot be refunded in this way (i.e., you can claim a refund for some tickets of a bulk booking
        this way, but each needs to be applied for individually for the specific person). In the case of hospitalisation
        or death, a full refund will be provided. These are granted at the discretion of the organising committee and a
        medical certificate may be&nbsp;requested.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;All refunds are less applicable bank changes and
        Quicket booking fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
